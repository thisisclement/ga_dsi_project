407,"The difference between PTSD and C-PTSD. PTSD is caused by exposure to a single traumatic event, such as robbery, military combat or a serious accident. With appropriate treatment, full recovery can happen.

Complex-PTSD typically occurs after prolonged, repetitive interpersonal traumas. These traumas build layer upon layer in the brain and body. 

Due to the nature of C-PTSD being rooted in events such as childhood abuse, domestic violence, it is often inescapable, especially for younger victims.

Unlike PTSD, C-PTSD affects the development of psyche and how we perceive the world around us. Recovery can be a lifelong journey, but there should never be shame attached.
