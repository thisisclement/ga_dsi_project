386,"I have completely lost hope in society Environmental destruction

Climate change

People voting in corrupt people and parties who only have the 1% at mind

Animal extinction from anthropogenic factors

People choosing conformity over uniqueness

The fact that poverty could be exponentially improved if the wealth gap was reduced (so basically: how greedy people are)

etc etc

All of this has literally caused me to become quite depressed and anxious over the last few years.

Where has everything we value gone? Does everyone just care about materialistic items now? and how much money we can make being our ultimate goal as a person, rather than improving ourselves as people?

407,"The difference between PTSD and C-PTSD. PTSD is caused by exposure to a single traumatic event, such as robbery, military combat or a serious accident. With appropriate treatment, full recovery can happen.

Complex-PTSD typically occurs after prolonged, repetitive interpersonal traumas. These traumas build layer upon layer in the brain and body. 

Due to the nature of C-PTSD being rooted in events such as childhood abuse, domestic violence, it is often inescapable, especially for younger victims.

Unlike PTSD, C-PTSD affects the development of psyche and how we perceive the world around us. Recovery can be a lifelong journey, but there should never be shame attached.

488,"Does anyone else feel as though awarness for mental health disorders is growing but only for certain disorders? I have noticed that over the last number of years there has been a growing, positive narrative on mental health, people genuinely are more aware of it but only when it comes to anxiety and depression. I feel as though other disorders e.g OCD and psychotic disorders are being left behind within the public narrative. It appears to me that psychotic disorders for example are still in the dark ages when it comes to public awareness. People are scared of people with psychosis and are not treated with the same respected / care by the public as someone with anxiety or  are feared by a large portion of the general public. Many people have ideas that they are violent which is completely not true. 

TL;DR: The public narrative about mental health is leaving certain disorders in the dark e.g psychosis and OCD unlike anxiety and depression which get most if not all the attention.

808,"Kate Spade Suicide - Media Miseducates the Public about Bipolar Suicide Some people with Bipolar ""Depression"" will never understand their own illness.  The profession of psychiatry is partly to blame for the fact that most people are miseducated about serious 'mental'  illness.  The terminology ""depression"" and their characterization of ""mood disorder"" are roots of the problem.  The media does their job to spread misunderstanding, often referring to someone having ""battled demons"" or struggling with ""mental health issues"".



This article is written by an expert on the topic of Bipolar suicide:



This was a superbly written article, but even so, it is possible that many people will still not understand.  We are conditioned to think that suicide is caused by extreme sadness and despair brought about by difficult life circumstances.  It is extremely difficult to break out of that mode of thinking to try and process some other conceptual explanation.  Many people who begin experiencing symptoms of Bipolar ""depression"" will try to make sense of it by attributing the dysphoric feelings to some acute stressor in their life.  This is where widespread misunderstanding of the disorder is so very dangerous...because people just do not know what they are dealing with and won't seek treatment.  Also, because of the deep-seated problems and ideological infighting in the world of psychiatry, some diagnosed people still do not understand their own illness.  

One note about the article:  The writer may or may not realize that someone who temporarily lacks insight (anosognosia...a neurological condition) due to acute psychosis will not be able to carry out a plan to save themselves.  Even psychosis is not what most people think it is.  Psychosis is not psychological detachment from  is a neurological detachment.

Some advocates are calling for what are called psychotic disorders to be reclassified out of the mental health system because they are not psychological/emotional/behavioral disorders (although they certainly affect emotional expression and behavior).  Bipolar, Schizophrenia, and other brain disorders that can cause psychosis are really neurological disorders that involve abnormal neural/electro-chemical abnormality in the brain and should be treated and insurance reimbursed under the mainstream medical health system.  Reclassification would not only help the general public to make progress in understanding these neurological disorders, it would lead to better access and reimbursement to treatment.
