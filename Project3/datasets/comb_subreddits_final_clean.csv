9,"I called the suicide hotline and the operator was rude to me. During and extreme panic attack/depressive episode, I was feeling like I was at the end of my rope, and I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I called the suicide hotline.

Right off the bat, she sounded like I was bothering her. Absolutely no compassion in her voice. She sound like she couldn‚Äôt get off the phone fast enough. 

I started babbling and she interrupted me and said ‚Äúma‚Äôam are you going to hurt yourself or not‚Äù

Me: umm...

Her: if you are, you can go to a crisis center. There‚Äôs one at so and so hospital.

Me: umm I don‚Äôt have insurance.

Her: well you can just pay

Me: I... don‚Äôt know if I want to go there

Her: .... so are you trying to harm yourself or *not*?

At that point I just hung up. She was making my anxiety worse.  

So I called the depression hotline. The man who answered was very kind and gentle, listened to me cry, comforted me, and gave me advice on what to do next time I was feeling like this.

So I guess the point of this post is there are other numbers to call when you feel like you‚Äôre out of options. And... don‚Äôt give up!

Edit to add:
The depression hotline number I called was local to my state, and I‚Äôm not sure if there is a national one but [this website]() has a list of local numbers you can call!

As I was walking out of her office I said ""I swear to God I'm gonna kill myself"" & she said ""Okay, kill yourself"". I turned around & said ""what?"" & she said ""Go ahead, kill yourself, go on"" & I stormed out, had a panic attack & called my sister. We went back to her office & she didn't want to speak to us & instead sent her secretary to talk to us. He told us to follow him outside, took us to the parking lot, yelled at us, squared up & called us sick. He said that since we are ""sick"" we should be careful. I told him that the doctor couldn't say those things to me & he said ""Who's the doctor? She is, so she can say it & you said it first."" Then he cussed at us & told us to leave. I have the audio recording of the secretary yelling at us & stuff. My parents are really mad & wanna report her.

55,"Just because some people don't make a scene of their mental disorders, doesn't mean they aren't struggling Just because some people don't look or act mentally ill, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem going on. If they are trying hard to hide it, it's possible they're struggling more since they have to hold it in. Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem and therefore aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with. And they definitely shouldn't have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they've struggled.

&#x200B;

I want people to get help without being told their OCD is for attention, and that their depression is just an excuse to be lazy, their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things, or their ADHD is just an excuse to misbehave. If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them.

&#x200B;

Nobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves.

&#x200B;

If anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this. Know that bottling it up will make it worse over time. Tell someone that will understand (maybe a school psychologist or a doctor) before it becomes too severe to fix easily. Once you do that, it will be so much easier.",1

And she said ‚ÄúNo, it won‚Äôt.‚Äù

And, for a second, I felt my heart break - but she continued.

‚ÄúBut it will be the most dominant part of you. Think of your body - if you break your shoulder, even after it heals it will be tender. It will be a sore spot. You will be careful with it. There will be a gentleness when you care for it. If you crack a rib, laughing will hurt and, even after there is no longer a fracture, you may laugh lighter *just in case.*¬†You can heal, but it is okay to be aware of the parts of you that once hurt the most. The most important thing to know is that where there is tenderness, let there be gentleness.‚Äù",1

I'm currently sitting behind my desk at work - my boss isn't in and I have my own office so I'm completely alone, with no one to bother me.

69,"Threatening suicide as a means of control: It is toxic. Don't do it. Two nights ago, I was approached by a user I don't know through Reddit chat. They're claiming to be 17, in Canada, and were making threats of cutting themselves, throwing up blood, taking pills, and running a bath to slip into presumably to ultimately die. I took the claims seriously and looked for the national suicide prevention center number, while a friend of mine found a mobile crisis team near where this user lives. I offered to call the authorities, but this user panicked and said they would put the razor back and go to bed. I asked if they told their parents anything that was going on and they hadn't, claiming that they weren't home.

What started all of this was apparently a breakup. Fine, I understand. I was a teenager once and it is easy to be emotionally charged without any direction, seeking validation. They asked if they could add me to Discord, because its ""easier"". This is what followed before I had to remove them, because I felt incredibly uncomfortable:

I bid them goodnight and offered to check in the morning. Then, this happened:

Since then, they have tried to add me again on Discord and make contact. I'm incredibly pissed off, as someone who attempted suicide twice in the past and as someone who used to self-harm as a teenager. I told no one. And, I get it, everyone handles mental illness differently, but this is manipulative behavior and it isn't okay. You do not get to guilt someone into adding you to a chat platform with suicide. **How dare you.**

**This kind of behavior further enforces the stigma around mental illness and suicide. This kind of behavior is why we are not taken seriously.**

Gross I know but it was a very quick nip and it was on the ground for less than a second. Anyway after I ate it I started getting anxious about ""what if I contract bird flu and die"" and started to overthink a lot about what diseases I could get and so on. I started to think about if I died how much I'd miss my friends, my family and how there's so much I still want to do like meet my future wife, have a family, help people, build a career, play xbox, play with my dog and enjoy surfing etc. And because of this I realised how much I actually want to be here and how much I love being alive and don't want to leave. 

A few months ago I was in a really dark place and I was getting scared I'd never see the light and it would just keep going downhill, and today a seagull stole my hotdog and I realised how happy I am and how far I've come, and I'm really proud of myself for improving my mental health and look forward to all the beautiful and exciting things to come in future.

82,"If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I‚Äôve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago. First and foremost you need some rest. I would say that 10/10 times when I have suicidal ideation it‚Äôs also when I am over tired or over worked.

Secondly there are people in your life that genuinely care enough to force you into help. I know it‚Äôs scary to reach out to them and admit that you are having a hard time alone but I whole heartedly recommend it. I would not be alive to type this if it weren‚Äôt for the wonderful people in my support network. One method my friend and I came up with is that I can kill myself, I just have to get his permission first. This gives me the benefit of having the ‚Äúoption‚Äù but also puts the social pressure on me to never do it. 

I know you might think no one gives a shit, but the same people who would be devastated if you died would probably prefer to help you out before it gets to that point. There is something socially validating about suicide in the brain of the suicidal. It feels easier than to admit you are having a hard time. You feel like people will take what you are going through seriously. But plain and simple you will not be around to enjoy that validation because you will be dead. And all the people who would have helped you will be asking what they could have done. Instead of leaving the people you love on this Earth with the trauma of dealing with your death, please reach out to them.

Lastly what you have gone through is not easy. You may feel exhausted, defeated or even angry at others. Self reflection might be productive but you are right to feel angry at how they treated you. What you do with that anger is your responsibility now and it seems like you are just letting it eat away at you. Maybe there is some way to can transfer that anger into productivity or artistic expression. Who knows?

You have real problems. They suck, you‚Äôre totally right to feel that way. You should feel no blame that shitty things happen to you. But these problems are still your responsibility. And there are people out there who can help. Again I would not be alive today if it wasn‚Äôt for the friend I mentioned above and a wonderful therapist who came in at the right time. You may not have luck the first few times; my first therapist sent me into a mental breakdown. But I promise you that you will find the right fit if you keep trying.

Focus on the problems that you can solve. I think about the serenity prayer they say in AA every day. ‚ÄúGrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference‚Äù. There are many issues in your life you may not have control over, but there are some that you do. Focus on those. Try to define them as precisely as possible. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúeverybody hates me‚Äù. Say ‚Äúeverybody hates me when I ______‚Äù. The first is a cry of defeat. The second gives you a concrete area of yourself that you can improve. I always tell my friend ‚Äúif you are going to hate yourself, at least be more specific‚Äù.

There is so much in life worth living for. A beautiful sunrise, your daughter‚Äôs graduation some day. Hell even if it‚Äôs just a new season of a tv show you love. The future is a mystery, and that‚Äôs a good thing. It means that everything is going to change. If things are good they are going to get worse. But that also means if things are bad they are going to get better. Take solace in that during the bad times and prepare yourself what things feel like they are going too well.

Don‚Äôt hesitate to dm me if there is anything I can help you with. We‚Äôre all on this crazy ride together.

God bless.

I hope that this post does not glamorize suicide attempts in any way. Yes I tried, but that doesn‚Äôt delegitimize the suffering of someone who hasn‚Äôt. Just because you haven‚Äôt attempted doesn‚Äôt make your situation any less valid or serious compared to anyone else‚Äôs. Remember my words above: a suicidal persons warped sense of reality tells them that suicide is a better option than reaching out for help. It is not. Ever.

Many of you have reached out to me in a PM and I thank you for reaching out to someone. I am always a friend in need to someone but I am not a professional. There are REAL professionals out there making a difference just waiting to be the change you need in your life. Remember the best thing you can do is reach out.

Thank you. I‚Äôm a student and really struggling with money. I also have CPTSD and severe anxiety, and I haven‚Äôt left my room in a while.

You said it already went to print so you didn‚Äôt want to bother re-entering it, so you let me have my drink for free.

90,"Why isn‚Äôt there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies? Why do emergency rooms exist for physical or extreme mental concerns but there is no such thing as a walk-in urgent mental health clinic?

I‚Äôve wondered this for years. I‚Äôve always had a panic disorder. During my first terrible panic attack at 21, I remember googling different mental health facilities in the area and limited info came up. I ended up calling the cops because I was afraid and felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, but knew it was psychological. The cops showed up and the only assistance they provided was suggesting that I sat in the back seat of their car. I felt ashamed sitting there, and as my panic dissipated, I just remember feeling hollow and empty. They couldn‚Äôt help me and unless I was truly a danger to myself or others, they weren‚Äôt going to commit me to any psych wards. So, they left and told me some ‚Äúmobile counselors‚Äù would be on the way.

Eventually, I went back home and sat alone for 3 hours, trying to relax. These ‚Äúmobile‚Äù counselors the cops said they would provide me with decided to give me a call and ask if I still wanted help. By that time I was fatigued, so I declined.

That‚Äôs when I came up with this question. At that moment I would‚Äôve loved to just walk into a place and talk to a counselor on-call. Not days or weeks of waiting to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist, nor being committed to a psych ward. Just real people with crises that they need help with.

Helplines, in my personal opinion, aren‚Äôt the same type of treatment. I‚Äôve only tried a couple though, so I‚Äôm not entirely certain on it. Though, in some cases, slight medication intervention might be necessary, and personally I prefer a face-to-face conversation. 

In addition, if this concept could actually work, what would one have to do in order to be able to open such a place?",1
91,"I got an apology from my old psychiatrist When I was 13 (around the early 2000s) my parents got worried as I was making the transition from elementary school to middle school. They had me see a psychiatrist who did no testing or talking with me before writing me a prescription for some SSRIs. The dosage was very high and my parents weren't told to taper me on or off. 


I had intense sleepiness, trouble caring about things, trouble remembering my friends' names. I slept so deeply that I didn't even wake up to my body's signals to use the bathroom; I was a teenaged boy pissing his own bed. My grades plummeted and that made my parents simply insist on higher doses. The psychiatrist I was seeing wrote those prescriptions too, still never looked me in the eye. 


I knew something was wrong, but it was months before I could focus enough to tell my parents. Luckily they listened and I never had to take those pills again. But for the next 18 years I went through life blaming myself for not adjusting to a new school quickly enough or well enough. When I was old enough to make my own appointments, I spent hours and hours (and hundreds of dollars) getting evaluated for every possible mental illness. I even had blood tests. All the tests came back saying I was normal and healthy, but it still tugged at me. 


A few weeks ago I found the courage to find that psychiatrist and then I wrote him a letter asking for an apology. I was respectful, stating the facts of the matter first and then moving on to how it made me feel in the years afterward. I was clear that I only wanted an apology, but didn't want to smear his reputation or harm him. I told him that he could reply or he could not, and if he didn't reply I wouldn't bother him further. 


Today he found me via Facebook and apologized. The relief and the confirmation I felt was nearly overwhelming. 


I spent years thinking I was weak, dangerous, crazy, and unreliable. But I'm not. I am sane. I am strong. I am dependable. I DO deserve the good life that I have.",1

I have a habit of I misinterpreting behaviors of others and irrationally take small things as a personal attack on me which is insane. I think this is rooted in my insecurities and deep down I believe everyone is out to get me or be mean to me. 

unlike most people I should NOT follow my heart and actually use logic and talking to someone who is more objective than I am in any given situation.

115,"High schools need therapists and real resources for suicidal students, not just non-suicide contracts First time posting here, please don‚Äôt mind the rambly-ness of this. Today I was thinking about something that happened years ago that made me realize schools don‚Äôt do much about suicidal students. 

When I was in high school I was severely depressed and going through a really difficult time in my life due to my parents divorce, particularly after being sent to live with my neglectful and abusive dad. I was self harming, battling an eating disorder, and was barely sleeping at night. I was absolutely struggling pretty clearly on the outside. I had a teacher tease me for looking so miserable at school every day and I got in trouble for being inattentive or dozing off in classes among my high-achieving peers. It was a rough time. 

I remember changing a password to something I accessed at school to iwannadie. It must have been flagged because I was sent to my guidance counselor, who really only ever gave people advice and help with applying to college, and she basically got me in trouble and threatened to tell my parents, and made me sign a contract that I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself. It totally cured me of all depression and I was never suicidal again! /s

Anyway, it upsets me that they didn‚Äôt do anything more about this. They didn‚Äôt mention it to my parents or anyone else, they never followed up again, and didn‚Äôt have a therapist or a professional to refer me to, in school or out. 

Schools need to have a resource for students. I was so vulnerable and depressed and I was shamed for it rather than helped. Guidance counselors don‚Äôt really have time for this, which is understandable, but they MUST have someone else there to support students during tough times if that‚Äôs the case.",1

I was there that morning. I arrived right after the police. It was like a scene in a movie. Emergency lights flashed from every direction. I left my car in the middle of the road, door open, pushed past all the police in the street, and ran into the house. 

Looking back on that day I can see myself as if I was watching from above. My sister and her husband were inconsolable.  Police everywhere. The screams, and tears. All the phone calls. It‚Äôs such a blur. But what is clear are the moments I was able to sit with her before she was taken away. The quiet in her room was deafening. I wanted it all to stop. I wanted to turn back the clock. To have one more chance. As I sat there the realization hit me like wave. Everything had changed. I couldn‚Äôt stop it. Nothing would ever be the same again. My niece... she was gone. 

It‚Äôs been sixteen months and no one has ‚Äúmoved on‚Äù.  It‚Äôs something we carry with us every day. It‚Äôs part of all of us. That loss, the grief, the anger and disbelief. It makes every step harder to make and every breath harder to take. 

My niece was in pain. Blinding pain. I sat on the front steps that morning and read the note she left. 10 pages of writing as the drugs took effect. She was more afraid of waking up then dying. Those were her exact words!  She was only two months shy of 18, yet she couldn‚Äôt see the light her future held. Any hope she had gathered over time had slipped through her fingers. She couldn‚Äôt hold on any longer. 

I‚Äôm grateful that her pain has stopped but I wish she could have seen or felt the love she was leaving behind. The devastation that has ripped through our family is the result of the tremendous love we all felt for her.  She was our light. She brought so much joy to us all. Yet she struggled to feel any herself. 

Life will never be the same. People tell you that things will get better in time. A big part of me wants to scream that I don‚Äôt want everything to be ok because it‚Äôs not.  We‚Äôre not and never will be. We‚Äôre all a mess. My kids still struggle every day.  She was a regular part of their life. She loved them unconditionally and them her. How do you explain why this disease could take her away and why we couldn‚Äôt help her.  They are too young to have to deal with anxiety and depression, and loss. 

What I wouldn‚Äôt give for another chance to reach her. Knowing the pain she was in crushed my soul. She had the most beautiful heart. If only she could have felt how loved she was. 

If you are struggling with depression or thinking about suicide, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reach out for help. You are not alone. You deserve to feel love and happiness. You might not feel it or see it right now but there are people who care, who see your worth, who understand your pain, and want to help.

I have so much respect for teachers. I am interviewing for other schools, but I will most likely do a mix of tutoring/sub work/reception. I am still sad that I couldn't push through another school year, but I am feeling happier that I don't have to go back. I have options. And maybe someday, I will go back to the classroom in the future. I'm working on hobbies I've completely abandoned when I was working. Teaching is a huge commitment. I have mixed feelings about my ideal work situation, but I'm glad I'm taking the time to reflect and slowly plan my next steps.

This sub seems to mostly pay attention and support people whose mental illness makes it difficult for them to perform basic functions, like getting out of bed. I understand that life with mental illness is like a 10k race. For those struggling with the basics, every day moving a yard feels like a war against yourself, but what about those of us who are sprinting? 

I leave my house daily for work, social gatherings etc but I face many difficulties each day stemming from mental illness. I come here and I make posts about it. Hoping to find someone who feels the same. Who lives that struggle. Just one person who relates and reaches out and says yeah I'm drowning in my own thoughts too. Or hey I used to struggle with that here's what helped me. 

But I get nothing. And I see no posts on my feed from others who live a similar struggle. I'm sure they're out there, but their posts get buried or if they're anything like me, they delete them later because if no one feels the same, what's the point. All the support goes to the ones who seem to be struggling the most outwardly.

It reminds me of when I was a kid, and I had a troubled sister. I went to school, had poems put in the newspaper, great grades and had a few short stories published in books, but no one in my home paid any mind. When I left for college I asked my mother why she left me to my own devices so often. Why she didn't put so much effort into me like with my sister. She replied; ""because you've always done so well on your own, I didn't think you need me."" That has stuck with me even to this day,and that's how I feel about this sub. 

The support isn't shared and I think we all could do more to make sure there's a variety of lifestyles affected by mental illness getting the attention they deserve. No struggle is worth more than another, but they all need some help.",1
146,"Working in an ICU showed me the other side of suicide I‚Äôve been depressed for as long as I can remember, and for whatever reason it‚Äôs gotten much worse here lately. Sometimes my thoughts can be very dark (in regards to myself), but I‚Äôve fortunately been able to snap out of those thoughts. I‚Äôm unmedicated, but currently searching for a therapist, so no worries- that‚Äôs not the point of my story! 


I work at a hospital on a higher intensity care unit, and about once a week I will have to sit with a patient that is at risk for suicide or self harm. One of the most life changing people I sat with was a girl close to my age that had intended to OD the night before, and she woke up so happy to be alive. While she did some very extreme damage to her organs, she was crying because she was so thankful that she lived to see the next day. She didn‚Äôt leave behind her husband, or her friends, or her mom. That was a hard wake up call for me, and made me understand that suicide is not an okay exit for me. To have known that girl was in a place just as, or even more so, desperate than I have been, and actually went through with that tragic decision. Seeing her so happy to be alive made me realize how important it is to talk to someone when you‚Äôre not feeling okay. My job can be stressful, but moments like that remind me that the future is bright, no matter how dark the road you‚Äôre currently on.

154,"I finally shaved!!! Before anyone asks: I am a girl.

I haven't shaved in months and if you're grossed out by that, stop reading now. 

I haven't shaved anywhere. Legs, armpits, pubic area. It just seemed too overwhelming. My boyfriend doesn't mind, so my sex life didn't really get worse because of that and I live in a colder climate, so wearing long pants during the summer was completely normal.

To be honest, I kinda liked how things were. Less waste, more time, less skin irritation and stuff. But I knew it didn't come from my worldview, but from my depression. Shaving is the least important, as I could go days without eating, without brushing my teeth and showering. 

So before I go on: shaving isn't necessary, showering is. So if you're a male, female, whatever, just don't shave if you don't want to. It's not a part of hygiene. You won't ""sweat more"" because of some hair. But take a shower from time to time. Not a full-on spa singing one hour shower, but get in there for a few minutes. Even if it'll be just standing under pouring water. 

But if you want to - just like I did - go for it. I shaved my whole body today, I used some coconut oil on my legs and scented oil under my armpits (zero-waste deodorant!). Apart from that, I also did a full on skin care routine and brushed my teeth AND flossed. Wow.
I'm sure most people do it regularly and it grosses them out when they have a single piece of salad between their teeth after a meal. But for me, it was a huge milestone. I hope to do it again tomorrow, without forcing myself. I haven't felt this fresh and sexey in quite some time. Next goal: laundry!",1

Now, I‚Äôm traveling Europe alone for the first time. I‚Äôm doing what I want when I want, meeting new people, seeing things I never thought I‚Äôd see, and loving every minute of it. Every second I think about the fact that I could have not had this opportunity. I could have cut my life short and never been to Europe, never felt the freedom of standing at the top of a waterfall in Iceland or on the River Thames in London. 

I‚Äôm so thankful that I made the call before it was too late, and that I had people in my corner when I woke up in the emergency room that cold March morning. I‚Äôm glad that I chose life, despite how hard it can be, how cloudy and dark and hopeless it is at times. I‚Äôm glad that I sought help and got the help that I needed.

I still feel hopeless and lost and miserable sometimes. We all do. But I want every person here to take a deep breath before they consider ending their short, beautiful life too soon. You never know what more there is to see and feel and experience. I love myself now, and I love you all.

Cheers xx

172,"3 Years Today 3 years ago today I was on top of the biggest bridge in my city ready to jump. A man stopped and introduced himself and talked with me for a bit until police arrive and they took me down. 

I was battling depression and anxiety for 6 years prior to this. I was constantly bullied at school and even though I had a lot of friends I felt like I was acting happy all the time just so no one worried. 

When I was starting college I was doing well, I was somewhat happy, had good grades, but it got overwhelming and I realized that the program I was in might not have been for me.  

I ended up dropping out and as soon as this happened I was kicked out of the house. I slept in my car for a few days and then started staying in a guy's room that I met only a week prior. I stopped working because I didn't care anymore, I took out numerous payday loans to buy stupid things I thought I needed but never did. 

After the guy decided that he wanted to have a second girlfriend openly, I decided I couldn't do it anymore. I thought that no one wanted me and that I wasn't important. So I drove to the park by the bay, parked my car and made my walk up the 900m long bridge to the top. I remember feeling a bit happy walking up there like I knew it was good for me. 

After I was rescued I spent 3 days in the hospital. That was horrible, the nurses were rude and made fun of you and I wasn't allowed to go outside like the rest of the residents were. I ended up having an anxiety attack and when I get anxious I scratch my right forearm and this time my attack was so bad that I ripped through the skin (from wrist to elbow) and when the nurses saw that they didn't treat it, all they said was too bad, it was my fault.

After that I attempted suicide once more in March of 2016, I took 14 clonazepam and wouldn't let my mom into my apartment so she had to call the police and they came and took me to the hospital, I stayed there overnight and left the next day with no further help.

In April 2016 I was unable to afford my apartment that I had started renting in January so I moved in with my dad and step mom and had 2 months to find a job or else I was out. I worked at a coffee shop for a few days but left due to the other workers ignoring me and making me feel awkward.

I met a guy online that let me move in only 2 weeks after meeting (July 2016) and that was the worst mistake I ever made in my life. For a year and 3 months I was constantly abused, mentally, physically, emotionally, and financially. I was getting social assistance at that time and every time the pay would come in it would go to him for his drinking and drug habits. He would be so bad that sometimes I would find him passed out in the shower covered in puke and not responsive. He continuously would hit me and drag me around by my hair and always the next day he would apologize and make me feel better. 

In July of 2017 I tried to leave, I took my 2 rats and my clothes and moved in with my dad because I couldn't take it anymore but 3 days later I moved back in because he was going to change. We moved to a bigger city and rented a bachelor apartment and it was fine for about a week then he went back to drinking and since we were in a bigger city, drugs were easier to find. He would get drunk and high and beat me up, wake my up by kicking me and making me sleep on the floor with no blanket or pillow. He smashed my head off the hardwood floor multiple times and kicked me in the ribs. In October of 2017 I finally had enough. I ran outside after he slapped me across the face and called the police. He was arrested and I never saw him again. 

I have a no contact order against him and for the first while it was hard to cope with everything that happened. 

It took a lot to readjust to a normal life and get back on my feet.

3 YEARS LATER:

\- I am in an amazing relationship (1 year) with an amazing guy who tells me I'm beautiful everyday and makes me feel so happy.

\- I have a full time job which I love, I work with amazing people

\- I live on my own in a fairly sized 1 bedroom apartment with my cat and 2 rats.

\- I started paying off debt last October and currently have around $5500 left to pay.

178,"Mental illness isn‚Äôt a choice, we don‚Äôt wake up one day and say ‚ÄúHey you know what?! I want to start hearing voices in my head. That sounds like a great idea! Let‚Äôs throw in some anxiety and a dash of depression while we‚Äôre at it!‚Äù Living with a mother who has a mental illness, caused me to have a lot of resentment and anger as a child. It has also caused me to have my own issues with anxiety and depression. 

Bit of background story: My mom had her own business and was very successful. When I was 8 we had a flood in our house that completely destroyed her business. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but she started doing heavy drugs. She would constantly pass out and not eat for days. 

At 8, I was no longer a child but a parent. I remember going into our kitchen to cook food so she would eat and seeing pipes and burnt spoons on the counter. As a teenager she would trick me into thinking that we could practice driving so I could get my license. When in reality, she would be flagging people down the street asking if they had any drugs she could buy. Few years later, she was put in a psychiatric hospital. She had called the police telling them to stop following her and bugging her house. She was arrested and placed in a psychiatric facility and diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was later court ordered to stay in a half way house. After her time was up, she decided that she never needed help and was able to walk out freely without anyone stopping her. 

Anosognosia has serious consequences. I‚Äôve watched my family members step away from her like the plague because they became so angry with her that she wouldn‚Äôt admit that she needed help or believed that she was doing it on purpose for attention. They convinced themselves that she would somehow ‚Äúsnap out of it.‚Äù 

Here‚Äôs my main point in all of this, if a person does not think that they need help they will NOT get treatment. In coping with my own mental issues, forcing anyone to do something they hate is far worse for our mental health. Instead of fighting it, accept it for what it is  Stop putting these expectations on us that are unrealistic. Sometimes we don‚Äôt need help in the way you think is best. We don‚Äôt need further rejection or guilt. Most times we just need support. We need love.",1

180,"Does anyone else hate how people throw around the terms ""narcissist"" and ""sociopath"" on Reddit? Narcissistic personality disorder is a horrible, painful condition. It's a mental disorder that, just like any, ruins the lives of people who never wanted to be this way. Like other personality disorders it takes away someone's control over their own thoughts and behaviours and twists their perceptions of the world around them. They've quite often been through abuse which has led them to develop their condition, and often they aren't even able to see that there's anything wrong - just like in other psych conditions.

Sociopathy hasn't even been considered a real diagnosis for decades. The closest thing is antisocial personality disorder, which is another horrible condition that people are forced to live with. It damages someone's ability to empathise and feel positive emotions, their ability to control strong bursts of anger or sadness and to properly deal with their emotions, and it makes people struggle to control impulsive behaviour and fit in with society. Someone with ASPD isn't the stoic, emotionless killer from a horror film or the cool, charismatic, cunning CEO. In fact they're very often poor and not too clever, having grown up in toxic environments and never getting the support they need to develop properly.

Both of these conditions are extremely complex and very, very hard to identify and diagnose, even for an experienced psychiatrist sitting across from their patient.

Reddit uses these terms the way people used ""retarded"" a decade ago. People have taken crippling conditions that they know fuck all about beyond watching slasher films and Dr Phil, and turned them into slurs.

It's even worse just how readily people make these armchair diagnoses. Whenever anyone does something bad, they must be a *sociopath!* It couldn't just be that normal people like you and me sometimes do bad things for a variety of very complex reasons - no, they must be a sociopath (and that means monster!)

Whenever a /r/relationship_advice or /r/amitheasshole post describes someone doing something that could even just be interpreted as slightly unreasonable, or a slight overreaction, they're a TOXIC NARCISSIST! No, they didn't just snap because they've been under a lot of stress like any human can, they dont just seem unreasonable because we don't know what's going on in their head and know their side of the story. No, they're a NARCISSIST! And it seems *everyone* on Reddit knows at least one narcissist, usually more.


And how do you deal with someone who has a debilitating mental health condition? You cut them out of your life completely! After all, they're toxic and they'll ruin your life if you let them!

Maybe you've been eating healthy, exercising, expanding your horizons, seeing glimmers of hope and finally started to feel like you got this, like you're going to win.

Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the demons and bad wolves of your mind strike with extreme, discombobulating and overwhelming force. They seem more powerful than ever, like this formidable and intrepid foe, who makes you cower in fear and want to admit and accept defeat. It seems to you, you never had a chance. Sound familiar?

What you have to realize is, is that these are the desperate cries of a dying demon. The old quote about ""there are two wolves inside you, and the one which wins will be the one you feed"" holds true as a metaphor here - what has been happening is that the good wolf (or angel, if you like that metaphor) inside you has the upper hand, and is on the verge of defeating the bad wolf. You're scaring it, you've got it on it's last legs. It's terrified, it's looking around in fear, it's contemplating its final gambit.

So of course, this is when that wolf/demon pulls out all the stops. It's gonna hit you hard. It uses it's harshest, cruelest and most vile move, to try and scare the good wolf back into it's place. It will do anything - it'll feed you all your insecurities and regrets, it'll turn your closest loved ones into villains, it'll use shock and scare tactics. It will tempt you as much as it can with that which you know causes you to regress. It's almost like the final boss emerges, because I know from first hand experience, the power of negativity and fear in this moment is a terrible thing to behold, and often, it can be enough to shock us into retreat.

So what's the solution? It's fairly simple - be aware that your demons are on their last legs and being absolute bastards because they *know it*. They know you have it in you to finally beat them, so they use the seedy, more hidden angles, the sneaky stuff you may not have prepared for yet. This is a moment where many of us slip up and get forced into retreat and bargaining. For those of you who aren't sure how to deal with this yet, all I'd suggest it just being aware of what's happening. Think about this, and logically assess it. Maybe right now you're not as strong as you could be, and might be forced to take a knee. That's okay; it's okay to not quite have the potency within to finsh off your demons today - as long as you are willing to continue the battle, that's all you need.

If or when you feel more confident and like you know this system already, then you'll be more equipped to know what to do - you can understand that this is a hurdle, and it'll hurt, and it's not. at all. easy to emerge as the victor over a demon, but it's well within your capability to do so. You're almost like Neo in the Matrix - you are the most powerful one, the hero of your story and the one who wins in the end. But the bastards want to win, and they're desparate to win - so you aren't going to get an easy ride to victory. You'll need to eventually accept and acknowledge who you are and put the power within into practise. So from there and with that awareness, just stick it out to the end, even if you feel overwhelmed. Keep at it. Don't let your story be like some directors cut where the bad guys win and everyone gets bummed out. You're stronger than that, even if you can't see it, part of you realizes that and it's just about the timing, in your story it could happen soon or it could take a while; be open to your story potentially being either of those, and don't force the former or reject the latter.. Always keep in mind there are other players in the game who want to pretend or have you think it's been made unwinnable by design; ignore those motherf*ckers!

I myself can't pretend I have absolutely won yet, but I feel like I've been trying this long enough to provide whatever insight I have, and I've beaten the odds before. If it resonates, that's great, but if not, I'm welcoming to anything you have to comment. All I'm saying is, it's easy to take a knee and assume that was the limit of your power, when the actual facts with this type of thing are usually, not really - you understimated yoursef, and listened to the fear... Don't fear victory, and don't let fear have victory.",1

We came to the conclusion together, that I am fed up of being judged, and wanna change that and the hypocracy in my family. I just don't know how. We agreed that fixing that will hopefully mean I dont have the need to hurt myself, or lash out involuntarily. But that's only gonna be noticeable after a while. So can't comment on that right now.

194,"You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself? I remember feeling pretty smart when I was a kid. Maybe that's just how all kids feel but that's what I remember ‚Äì getting better grades than most other kids. During my teenage years I didn't work very hard and still got good grades. I even got accepted into a school that only took on students that got good grades. That's when things started to change. Everyone seemed so much smarter than me and it was really scary. I went from feeling like one of the smartest guys in the room to the dumbest ‚Äì and I'd let myself know just how dumb I was, beating myself up.

Soon, I wasn't just stupid, I was boring. Then I was ugly and weak and pathetic in the eyes of everyone. I felt like I was getting dumber. A brain fog had permeated my mind ‚Äì I couldn't think as fast. My grades slipped as I worked even less and started playing video games more. Gaming takes up your attention and the thoughts more or less stop.

I still managed to get into a decent university but I was ashamed of my accomplishment because all my classmates were moving on to much more prestigious ones. I lasted two and a half years at uni before the suicidal thoughts started to become a real plan. Scared, friendless and far from home, I decided not to go through with it one night ‚Äì the worst night of my life. Instead I called my mom late that night and early the next morning I was on a train home.

Since then, I've been living with my mom. I work as a waiter and the job sees a high staff turnover with a majority of people working there being students trying to earn some money in between their studies. I can feel them judging me when I tell them that it's all I do ‚Äì I'm not doing this part time while I chase my dreams. I don't have anything else going on. I'm a 25yo man living with his mom and working a minimum wage job.

I got help, of course ‚Äì talking to some professionals and taking pills ‚Äì but the thoughts never really left. I know I'm not supposed to indulge them. My therapist told me, *you wouldn't say those things to your best friend so why would you say them to yourself?* I would reply that my best friend isn't trying to sabotage and fuck up my life. But I was never trying to do that and yet I felt like I deserved to hear the the things I was telling myself and deserved the life I now had because of how stupid and pathetic I was.

Recently, after doing something stupid but totally forgivable and human, I googled 'Is it possible to get dumber?' The first result was the question: *Is it psychologically possible to get dumber* on Quora. One of the answers by Norma Pellett:

> My experience tells me yes. I know a woman who was articulate and educated. I moved away and saw her again after ten years. She had no opinions of her own and couldn't articulate a decent sentence.

> I asked other friends if she had been ill or in an accident. No, she hadn't. Then I heard her husband talking to her. He called her ‚Äùstupid‚Äù and told her what she was doing was idiotic. He berated her for several more minutes. She was so cowed by this abuse that she bought into his assessment of her intelligence.
> She became what he expected her to be.
> I was too young and unsure of myself to call him on it or even to try to find a way to help her. I am ashamed that I didn't do anything.
> I'm not even sure that thirty years ago people really thought of emotional abuse as abuse. There were no bruises or broken bones, but this was much worse.
> Don't spend any time with someone who puts you down ‚Äî not even if they say, ‚Äújust kidding‚Äù or ‚Äúcan't you take a joke?‚Äù Months and years of this ‚Äúhumor‚Äù can destroy anyone.

Abuse is a terrible thing and I don't want to diminish it or its victims but I couldn't help but compare the husband to the voice in my head. The abuse I put myself through. I imagine having another person tell you those things is a thousand times worse.

I have always thought that a smart person was smart no matter what. That they may not believe it and people might tell them otherwise but they were, unchangeably, smart. Maybe it's obvious to everyone else but it never occurred to me that people could become the person they were told they are. That their personality could be moulded. What my therapist should have told me is *You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?* Thinking of it that way it's hard to feel like I deserve it. There is not a person in the world that I believe deserves abuse.

So how to stop? It's important not to try telling yourself the opposite of the things you usually tell yourself. I'm not going to look in the mirror every day and tell myself I'm smart, confident, handsome etc. That just feels inauthentic and quite silly. What you have to do instead is learn to recognise the thoughts and externalize them ‚Äì think of them as not your own but rather your anxiety's or your depression's. Your illness is your own personal abuser. Then the next step will be to stop believing the thoughts by not giving them your attention. Don't think the opposite or try to argue with them (e.g. *I'm not ugly I'm beautiful*) instead, try to refocus on whatever it is you were doing. This is hard but can get easier with practice. Mindfulness meditations help. You can even try talking back to the thoughts as though you aren't taking them seriously, *Thanks anxiety, tell me that again! C'mon that's what you always say. Ha, that's a good one. I was hoping you were going to show up.*

I feel so far behind everyone else but I'm going to really try getting better this time.",1

201,"I think people who make jokes/say that people need to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or ‚Äúgrow a pair‚Äù or ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù are part of the problem. 


My friend tried to commit suicide last night. I watched him drive away in his car drunk and he went on the highway/motorway saying he didn‚Äôt care if he died. Tried to stop him but couldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not the issue though. 

I had no idea he was suicidal, his family had no idea he was suicidal, his friends had no idea. He‚Äôd kept his mouth shut and let these feelings fester. 

The conversation about male mental health is nowhere near what it needs to be. It is heading in the right direction sure, but at the moment it only seems to be a big deal when someone is on the brink of suicide or having severe depression. 

There is no emphasis on normal day to day life, people telling young boys to man up if they are upset. Saying be a man. This is vile behaviour and forces boys to stuff down their feelings and deal with it through anger since they feel they can‚Äôt talk it through. Even saying it to girls shows them that this is how they should act and that boys should act differently when it comes to feelings. 

In the US four times as many suicides are by males. 9% have daily anxiety or depression. Of those 9% only a quarter found help for it according to the national health survey 2010-13
Source: 

In the UK 76% of suicides are carried out by males and 12.5% men are affected by depression. Of the people that seek help through therapy only 36% are men. Then the most shocking stat from the UK, of all the things that kill men under 45, getting hit by a car, murder, heart attacks etc, the leading cause of death is suicide. I am an under 45 male in the UK and to know that the most likely way for me to die statistically is for me to kill myself is shocking and scary. 

Only 15% of men report they would take time off work to focus on mental health. 34% would feel embarrassed or ashamed to do so for a mental health issue compared to the 15% feeling ashamed for a physical injury. 38% would feel that their employer would look down on them for taking time off for a mental health issue compared to the 26% for a physical. 

Source: 

Even among my friends this sort of ‚Äúman up talk‚Äù happens where if a guy gets upset over something deemed trivial he gets told to stop being a girl. I personally am quite sensitive, when I get super angry I tend to tear up. I hate it because it sometimes weakens my argument but it‚Äôs just how I am. When I get angry I tear up. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúsad cry‚Äù I‚Äôm just angry. 

 I had an argument with a close female friend and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only joking, so stop crying and grow a pair, man up‚Äù. That says my feelings aren‚Äôt allowed because I‚Äôm male, because apparently I‚Äôm not supposed  to feel that way. I should be calm and collected at all times. But all that does is make my squash my feelings away and deal with them some other way. 

That other way can turn into depression and eventually suicide. 

We need to change the mental health conversation so that it‚Äôs not a conversation about men on the brink of suicide. I‚Äôm aware that it isn‚Äôt only aimed there but at the moment to me it feels like not enough is focused on males feeling  like they *can* talk their problems through with people.",1

I instinctively try to lighten up conversations with humour, which gives the impression that I'm doing fine. I've even had doctors and psychologists ask me if I think I'm suicidal, and when I hinted towards 'yes' (I couldn't bring myself to actually say it) they didn't even act like it was serious.

211,"My Golden Rules of Life with Mental Illness So, these are mine, as developed over the thirty years since I initially presented.  These are very much part of how I maintain my stability and a functional life.

**1) Mental illness is never a justification to act like an asshole.  EVER.**

Acting like an asshole is an action.  For every action, there is a thought process before that action happens.  ""I want to act like x.  I'm going to act like x.  Here is me acting like x.""  Through a lot of hard work and practice mine is more like, ""I want to act like x.  Nope.  I want to act like x but I'm not going to.""  

Does having a mental illness make that harder?  Absolutely.  Does having a mental illness make that impossible?  Absolutely not.  Yeah, manias make it hard.  Really hard, some days.  But hard isn't impossible.

Anything worth something of value in life is worth working for.  My relationships are worth working for.  My ability to function is worth working for.  My ability to be a stable adult is worth working for.  I am worth working for.

**2) Other people's ignorance is no reflection on my self worth.**

I have an illness.  It's just that.  An illness.  It is not ""all in my head.""  It is not imaginary.  It is not a big long list of things that the public tends to believe.

It's an illness.  And whatever ignorant thought about it that's out there is no reflection on who and what I am.  I will NOT allow other people's ignorance to have an affect on my beliefs about myself, just as I wouldn't allow a flat earther to attempt to convince me that I'm stupid for believing in millennia of science.

**3) Mental illness isn't an excuse.  It's a reason to fight harder.**

Let's be honest.  There's a lot of misconceptions about who we are as a community.  The public perception of mental illness is that having one means that you are potentially violent, stupid, incompetent, and on and on.  I work my freaking ass off to prove every one of those wrong.  

**4) Living a quiet, boring, predictable life helps me maintain my stability.**

The more unpredictable my life is, the more unpredictable my mind becomes.  The more stable my life is, the more stable I am.  I have a great deal of control over this so I have a great deal of control over my stability.

**5) Daily self care is vital.  Exercise.  Eating a proper diet.  Spending at least a little bit of time on relaxing hobbies.  All of it.**

Again, all of this is about maintaining my stability.  Self care, even when it's a struggle, helps me do that.  It helps me maintain my physical health as well.  Poor physical health can (and for me, does) increase depression symptoms.

**6) I have to be careful, very careful, with any substance that can affect my thinking.**  

I have a hard enough time with my thinking processes.  Why would I want to make it harder?  

I don't touch drugs with a ten foot pole.  Even pot.  I'm allergic to it, but I do understand that it's a different classification than other drugs and it's affects are different.  BUT I'M ALLERGIC TO IT.  All the rest of them, the potential consequences are way too serious for someone who has difficulty maintaining stability.

I'm even extremely careful with alcohol.  I'm not concerned about addiction.  But alcohol makes me emotionally erratic.  I can have one glass of wine and be fine.  But about one and a half or two.... Yeah, it's entirely unpredictable on how I'm going to react that day.  So it's my responsibility to be careful with that.  I know my limits and I'm extremely careful with them.

**7) I have a responsibility for clear, straight forward communication with my loved ones about my mental illness.**  

I don't beat around the bush.  I don't wait for them to ask.  I say it.  Straight out.  I can't expect them to see into my head and know what's going on.  I have to tell them.  And I have to tell them in an honest and straight forward way.

**8) Managing my illness is my responsibility and no one else's.**

Period.

Ok, that's what I can think of for now.  But if you have your own, please add on.

215,"My 9-year-old is madly obsessed with me. Any advice? &#x200B;

At first it seemed very cute and sweet, like a ‚ÄúCrush‚Äù sort of thing. Through this past few years it has been escalating to a point where it is creepy and I fear for her mental health and future safety. I‚Äôm telling this story as a way of trying to get some opinions. 

Let‚Äôs call her Cindy, she is a daughter of a cousin of mine who I am not that close to, but we still get along pretty well. I‚Äôm going to share some anecdotes so you all can see what I mean. 

We come from a family where reunions and parties are common and happen at least once a month. So, we all see each other frequently. Cindy always wants to be around me, she wants me to play with her and hold her every minute of every single reunion. Whenever I dare to hug, say hi, or even acknowledge any other member of the family (especially when it comes to younger females of the family) she would get upset and throw a tantrum, running away onto the streets. Whenever the family starts dancing outside (which is pretty often lol) Cindy makes me pick her up and dance with her. I can only dance with her, no other female is allowed near me, I can‚Äôt even put her down to go the bathroom or have a drink. And whenever I did put her down well‚Ä¶ temper tantrum time. 

She once smacked her youngest sister (Mia, 2-year-old) so hard it almost knocked her out, just because she was walking around the house, spotted me, smiled, and wanted to get close to say hi. 

Anytime another female of the family would bring me something to eat or drink, she would make me give it back or throw it away so she could go and bring me whatever I had just been given. 

One time I did not show up to one of those reunions because some other plan that sounded more fun came around (dick move I know). Cindy asked everyone a thousand times where I was, and why I wasn‚Äôt showing up. Eventually they got tired of her and decided to call me, I explained that I was hanging out with some friends. When they told her about this, she got furious, grabbed a stone and threw it at the nearest car, breaking one of the windows. She then locked herself up inside one of the rooms. 

3 or 4 times a week, Cindy‚Äôs mom would call me, telling me Cindy wanted me to come over so I could help her with her homework. Sometimes, her other sister (8-year-old) would ask for my help too, causing Cindy to flip out, throw things at her, and call her names. Whenever I refused the invitation to help Cindy with her hw, she would start ripping her notebooks and textbooks, or pouring water on them. 

She then started to force her parents to bring her to my place every other day, even if it was for a short visit. This One time they left her with me because they needed someone to watch her to do some errands. Cindy was in my room, and I left for a couple of minutes to get her some snacks. When I came back, I found her going thru my clothes. She started crying and said she wanted to steal one of my t-shirts so she could remember me with it. I thought it was kind weird, but cute in a way. I told her she could have one of her choosing. Each time she came over after that she demanded a new shirt to take. I told her I couldn‚Äôt give her anymore shirts because I don‚Äôt have many. (which is true) Every time she would come, we would have the exact same conversation, until, without me noticing, she took pretty much all my shirts and stuffed them inside her backpack. Her mother had to come back the next day and give them back. 

I used to play along and not say much to her or her mother because, like I said, I thought it just was a ‚Äúcrush‚Äù or just a little girl overly attached to an older family member. It escalated gradually to a point which I didn‚Äôt know what to do. And besides, I‚Äôm really not into confrontation, so I didn‚Äôt want to cause any trouble. 

Last time I saw Cindy was this past weekend. (another family reunion) but this time, I brought my new girlfriend with me (she was my best friend for 6 years but I escaped the friendzone haha). Cindy was using crutches because she had gotten injured doing something or other while at school, so she couldn‚Äôt follow me around like she usually does. 

Obviously, she got furious when she met my girlfriend, but she didn‚Äôt say much. She sat right between us and didn‚Äôt let us kiss, hug or dance. Laura (my gf) Went to grab a drink for both of us, and immediately Cindy started moving around so she was occupying the rest of the sofa. When Laura came back, she refused to move and let her sit. I lost my patience (even when I lose my patience, I‚Äôm still pretty chill) and told her that she was being mean to my GF and that meant she was also being mean to me. I also told her we (Me and Laura) would have to leave if she kept it up.

Cindy lost it, she started screaming and kicking, she called Laura every name in the book and finished by saying that if we continued being together, she would shoot us both with his father‚Äôs gun. Turns out my cousin is not very bright, and it took her this long to realize something might be wrong with her daughter. My cousin pulled me aside and I told her everything, everything I just told you and a lot more. I advised her to seek help for Cindy and told her it was best if I stayed away for a while. 

Im really worried about Cindy and her wellbeing. So please, if anyone has gone thru something similar, or if some of you understand what is going on and what can I do to help. I would gladly listen. 

Thank you. Ps. English is not my first language so sorry if some of the writing is gibberish.",1

You guys need to stop throwing disorders at the people who come here asking for help. You're not a doctor, you're not a psychiatrist you're not a psychologist.


If you were, you would be smart enough to understand that you cannot diagnose someone based off of stuff they type online. There are literally 100000x things that a doctor needs to analyze in person in order to make an educated decision about something.


But no, it's way easier to get an upvote by saying ""Hmm I read that depression makes you not care so you probably have depression. Sociopaths also don't care so you are probably a sociopath also.""


This entire subreddit makes me sad. People come here for legitimate help and instead they get the r/iamverysmart crowd giving them misinformation.

227,"[Personal victory] For the first time ever, I was able to calm myself down after a panic attack, instead of going crazy in my own head My SO went out of town last night to go out with the guys. I generally try not to bother him when he‚Äôs out doing that because that‚Äôs his time to do what he wants. He has not come yet, which is fine by me. However, the one message I sent him asking ‚Äúis there plans we made for this weekend that I forgot about?‚Äù, he has yet to respond to. It‚Äôs been six hours since he was last active according to Facebook messenger. 

My panic attack started when I had this insane thought ‚Äúwas he out all night boozing around getting frisky/messing with other women?‚Äù. My heart started racing, my mind was running wild, I started to breathe heavier and heavier. I was in this state for about 30 minutes trying to remain calm. 

Finally, I took a deep breath and thought to myself: ‚ÄúIf he didn‚Äôt cheat on me, I‚Äôm worked up for no reason. If he DID cheat, I will deal with him later.‚Äù There was nothing I could do at that point in time, because he either did or didn‚Äôt do anything. But getting worked up about it now literally does nothing but make me miserable. 

I view this (the calming myself down part) as a personal victory. I‚Äôve never been good at handling panic attacks well when I‚Äôm by myself. So I am kind of proud of myself.

Also, Sandi is one of the only reasons I leave the house, other than work.

And this isn't me being worried about what other people think... it's more like a curiosity cause i have no clue who i am and what my personality is but someone like my friends or family might.

240,"I was finally accurately diagnosed after 12 years thanks to the show 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'  

Throwaway account for reasons that may be obvious and a **Spoiler** for season 3 of the show.

Let me start off by giving you guys some backstory. I have been in therapy for a wide array of issues: Compulsive spending, depression, anxiety, manic episodes, suicidal attempts. I attempted many times to get a diagnosis but I wouldn't share any embarrassing details that I will share with you. Every psychiatrist I would see would base these disorders off as the result of childhood trauma and an absent father. I was on all the medications you‚Äôve probably heard of Buspar, Prozac, Xanax, and Zoloft. 

My relationships have never really been stable in both interpersonal and romantic areas. I‚Äôve had 3 romantic relationships my entire life with the longest relationship lasting 6 months. Whenever I developed feelings for someone it would turn into severe infatuation where it went as far as stalking, rearranging my work schedule to be able to interact with him, and try to change my physical appearance in order to get them to fall for me. I am not proud of any of this but I need to stop denying that this was happening. With friendships, whenever a friend would cancel plans like drinks at the bar I would fall into a severe depression where suicidal thoughts would come to mind. I would call these friends and tell them I was considering suicide in order to get them to come see me. 

My manic episodes started getting pretty severe over the past few months to the point where I would take a week off from work and take lavish spontaneous trips to Europe, I started having auditory hallucinations of a ‚Äòsane me‚Äô insulting me and calling me crazy. I would go to Vegas on weekends to go on an alcohol binger and have numerous random sexual encounters. I would also lock myself in my room after work and watch TV for 6 hours straight. I will admit, I was too ashamed to open up about this as I was scared of being institutionalized and being known in my family as the freak.

In August, I wanted to start watching a new show and came across the show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. I had heard of the show before but because of the name I thought it was related to the meme I had grown annoyed of so I never really gave it a chance. As I started watching I was horrified that there were a few similarities between myself and the character Rebecca Bunch, the stalking, lavish spending, fear of abandonment, the hallucinations. The fact that she was the titular ‚ÄúCrazy Ex-Girlfriend‚Äù left me in a slight depression and I almost stopped watching. However when I reached season 3 where Rebecca finally gets diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I decided to finally go to a new psychiatrist to get another opinion and decided not to hold back any information that I was scared would be regarded as ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô people behavior. Thanks to the show‚Äôs portrayal of mental illness, I was finally able to open up about the stalking, the auditory hallucinations, and everything in between. After 12 years of therapy my official diagnosis is Self-Destructive Borderline and while the road to recovery will be a long one, I am hopeful that someday I will be able to completely manage my BPD. If you're currently going through something similar know that you aren't alone and the medical professionals are there to help you not judge you.

TLDR; Was an undiagnosed Borderline for 12 years but thanks to the show‚Äôs portrayal of mental illness I finally opened up about topics I was ashamed to admit, finally getting an accurate diagnosis.",1

249,"I no longer want to die. This time 2 months ago, I was 34 weeks pregnant, with an adoption plan in place to relinquish my baby at birth. After years of suffering heavily with my mental health, I thought I was too fucked up to be able to love a child. No maternal instincts, I couldn‚Äôt even look after myself, how the fuck would I look after a baby?

I thought it‚Äôd be cruel to subject a child to a lifetime with me. That my baby would be better with someone else, I concealed the pregnancy from my entire family, I‚Äôd completely isolated myself from everybody, convinced that I would give birth, give up my baby, and never tell a soul. 

The isolation, spending weeks on end alone in a flat without leaving the house led to a massive decline in my already dire mental health. At 8 months pregnant, an ambulance was called to me at a multi story car park at 3am. I couldn‚Äôt do it, not when there was only a few weeks to go, as much as I wanted to die, I figured I‚Äôd hang on just 4 more weeks until my baby was born, then I‚Äôd do it. 

This led to many services getting involved, social workers, specialist midwives, the crisis team, the home treatment team and even perinatal mental health specialists. I‚Äôm not going to go into detail about the home environment I was in, because it still pains me to this day, but it was heavily infested with rats, only one window to the whole place, but because I was heavily pregnant (suffering with carpal tunnel) and could no longer work (I‚Äôm self employed, no maternity leave/pay.) I was stuck there, In this dungeon, 8 months pregnant stuck in a dark hell hole I couldn‚Äôt go outside due to concealing my pregnancy, listening to rats chewing through the walls around me. I was so ready to die.

Then, my family tried to barge in, convinced that I had fallen into a horrible drug addiction or worse, was rotting away alone, I promised that I would see them the next day and tell them what was happening. They thought this was me being ready to open up, get help, when really it was me giving up. I had nothing left to lose, I planned on being dead soon anyway, and I missed them. During my pregnancy, because of me concealing it i had to miss seeing my mother in hospital after she was rushed in for emergency surgery, my family dog dying (I never got to say goodbye) and, the death of my aunty and her funeral. I figured if I was going to die soon, I wanted to spend my last bit of time with them. I was surrendering, the adoption plan was in place, my baby would have a good life.

My family were supportive, as I knew they would be. Many services presumed my reason for hiding the pregnancy from them was out of fear, but it was the opposite. I‚Äôm lucky to come from a loving wealthy family who I didn‚Äôt want to change my mind. I wanted to die. 

My family begged me not to go through with the adoption, my mother offering to take full custody of my baby if I tried motherhood and didn‚Äôt like it. I wanted them to be happy, I thought he could be my replacement when I was gone, that he‚Äôd keep them busy and take some weight off their grief of losing me. I agreed, my mother got me to move back in with her, and I enjoyed the luxuries of sleeping at night not worrying about rats crawling over me and having access to hot water again. 

12 days after I told my family I was pregnant, my beautiful baby boy was born, 3 weeks early. From the second I first held him, he was my boy, and he wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.

From the moment he was here, it‚Äôs like my mental illness has been an awful boot camp that I‚Äôve finally graduated. Like all my suffering is now worth something. 

As you‚Äôll know, BPD amplified all emotions, I feel everything so intensely my emotions are like a physical sensation. In the past, this has caused me so much pain and heartbreak, until the second I first held my son, and the feeling of maternal love flooded me with the most intense, incredible feeling i could ever imagine. Something I never imagined I could feel, that I thought I was too fucked up to experience, came to me so naturally. And now I have a little human who I can love as much as I want and it doesn‚Äôt aggravate him. I‚Äôm never ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô for him, because he needs me and depends on me fully. How can I possibly be suicidal anymore when I have my baby who will always need me?

All those nights I‚Äôve spent awake all hours in tears, seem like preparation for the sleepless nights of having a newborn (,minus the tears!) 

My baby has become my fixation, and the best part? He wants all of my love, he doesn‚Äôt want space from me. And I‚Äôm never alone anymore. I have somebody to be strong for. Do I still feel like shit sometimes? Absolutely. But I don‚Äôt get the chance to feel like shit for too long, cause my baby keeps me busy! My overthinking myself into depressive episodes? Don‚Äôt have the time anymore, my boy needs me.

I never imagined being a mother, and I never imagined getting better.. which I‚Äôm still not fully. But I‚Äôm the best I‚Äôve been in years, and for the first time in a truly long time, I‚Äôm no longer suicidal. I want to be here, I want to care for my son, make sure he‚Äôs so loved that he‚Äôll never feel unwanted like I have. And with him around, I can‚Äôt imagine feeling unwanted for a long time (until he‚Äôs old enough for me to be embarrassing!)

It‚Äôs like all the love that I‚Äôve had to give finally has a place to go. I‚Äôm so happy. I look at him and I just want to do right by him, to be the best mother I can be. 

2 months ago I was 8 months pregnant, isolated from everybody, in a dark rat infested flat, planning on ending my life.

Now, I‚Äôm currently led on my big comfy double bed, watching my 6 week old baby sleeping peacefully beside me in his Moses basket, in a nice light clean house, smiling to myself and making plans for our future. 

I always rolled my eyes when people told me it gets better. I‚Äôd suffered over a decade of things just getting worse, until this year, I‚Äôd finally hit rock bottom. 

Now I‚Äôm on top of the world. I‚Äôve never been happier than I have being a mother. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve truly enjoyed being alive. 

This turned into a huge essay, but I don‚Äôt like sharing this too much IRL because of the shame and embarrassment of living in such poor conditions, the state my mental health had got to, and also now that he‚Äôs here... it breaks my heart to think I ever even considered adoption.

I‚Äôve been heavily and closely monitored by many services, and in the 6 weeks since his birth, I‚Äôve been discharged by 4, and have reduced visits from daily to fortnightly/monthly by all of them. They all tell me how amazing I‚Äôm doing at being a mother, and how in their professions it‚Äôs so nice to see a happy ending.

251,"I don't want to turn into a violent, angry, incel [M 21] Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I saw the recent documentary on incels by the BBC, and it was just me staring at what I've become.

&#x200B;

I'm socially maladjusted due to my upbringing, my parents didn't allow me to interact with other kids, so my social skills dwindled ever since. I have a lot of social anxiety, and can barely look people in the eyes. My posture is stiff, I can't smile, I'm paranoid that everyone hates me.

&#x200B;

Because of this, I tried to find a community of others that felt similar to me. I dwelled within incel forums for the past 2-3 years, but I don't want to live this way. I see people on there talking about the most fucked up shit, and I sometimes smiled about it. I don't want to be this way.

&#x200B;

I want help but I don't know what to do. How do I become socially successful and beat social anxiety? I want to be accepted by others, not become a sick person.

Is it even possible for me? I don't have any friends, social-skills, or people to support me.",1

That definitely plays a huge role is people who have depression, anxiety, stress, guilt and those types of things could snowball into more serious issues.

260,"To anyone who was hurt, abused, manipulated or ridiculed by parents/caregivers: it's not your fault and it's not your job to fix them and their shitty problems. I have come to fully understand something, at 25 years of age - it's not your fault how adults treated you when you were a kid. You literally had not a single ounce of control over their stupidity, selfishness and incapability.

If you were abused, hurt, ripped apart by their words or even physically injured by those so-called grown-ups in your childhood, **it is absolutely and categorically not your fault**. And it is not your job to fix it. It's not your job now and it wasn't your job then. You had no control over their actions and no responsibility for them. They had the responsibility to care for you and they messed it up big time. You did not ask to be born into the situation you were born into. You were a vulnerable child whose needs, for some reason or another, were not fully met. And that rests entirely with the adults, not with you. A child can never be blamed for that. And the child who turns into the adult should not blame themselves for their parents' shortcomings, either.

Also, **you owe them nothing**. They may have fed you and put a roof over your head, but if they otherwise treated you like shit, or still do treat you like shit, walk away and don't look back. Now you're an adult and you have choices and autonomy over your own life. You don't need to be around them if you don't want to, or if it doesn't feel safe and secure.

I am so sorry that this happened to you and, believe me, I understand. Parents are not all as brilliant and kind as they're supposed to be. Some of them are assholes. Just want you to know you're not alone and you can live a happy life as an adult, without them.",1

I work a full-time job, with benefits. Financially, I'm not rich, but I'm not poor. My insurance supposedly covers mental health services, but I recently made the call for a referral, and I was only given a list of 3 providers. None of them are accepting new patients, and even if they were, I can't find enough info on them online to even know if they will be a good fit for me.

There are a few providers in town that I think I would feel really comfortable with, but they are not covered under my insurance and I cannot afford to pay out of pocket. I make enough that I don't qualify for sliding scale, but not enough to actually pay the full rates.

This is ridiculous to me that, at this point in my life, I am more financially stable than I ever have been and quite frankly, pretty privileged in terms of money. Yet, I cannot get decent mental health care.

Honestly, it scares me and it makes me feel a bit hopeless. I've been going back and forth with even wanting help, and it took a lot for me to finally decide to make that phone call. I'm super disappointed that I am not finding anything that can help me.",1

264,"Suicidal father left this morning and never came back. **Positive update below**

The title says it all. I‚Äôm at a loss for words. 
Back in December my father left and didn‚Äôt come back. He was gone for almost a week and came home ready to get help for his depression and suicidal thoughts. Since then he‚Äôs been going to therapy and seeing a psychiatrist multiple times a week. The last few weeks he has been in a much better mood. Yesterday he helped my mom spray paint the favors for my wedding in March. My mom left the house this morning to run an errand and they planned on going to the movies and lunch today. She came home and he left all of his belongings and only took his drivers license. 

My brother and I drove around for hours. My mom called the police to make a report. Other than that it‚Äôs literally just a waiting game. 

I feel like this time is different. I want to stay positive but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I suffer from depression and anxiety myself and I feel so lost. 

**Update**: Still not back. Still no word. My mother is losing her shit. I don‚Äôt think her poor heart can take this again. Keep us in your thoughts. 

**Update**: He just walked in the door. He said that he went for a walk to clear his head and by the time he stopped walking it was night. He was afraid to come home because he realized he was gone for so long. He slept at a park. It took him the whole day to walk back home. Still have a lot of worrying and stress to unpack but thank you EVERYONE for the kind words and positivity. This sub has been a life line and I appreciate each one of you. This journey isn‚Äôt even close to over but him being home is a start. ",1

We have been together for 11 years, engaged for only 4 months. For the last 5 years, I‚Äôve been living with terminal cancer and he‚Äôs been my rock. My mental health has been very touchy as one can imagine having incurable cancer and he‚Äôs been the one thing keeping me here and fighting. I actually did a clinical trial that surprisingly helped me. We‚Äôre just getting to a place with my health where maybe I can live a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. We‚Äôre supposed to be leaving on vacation in a few weeks and finally got to a point where we can plan things for the future. Theres so much coming up. I‚Äôve been improving myself and my mental health A LOT. He says he sees these improvements and they should make him happy, but it doesn‚Äôt. He told me when I just had my scans, he should‚Äôve felt something, but he didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs lost his compassion for me and isn‚Äôt in love with me anymore. I supported him through school and now that he‚Äôs done, he‚Äôs not only my emotional, but my financial rock, as well as helping me with things my disability makes hard. I don‚Äôt have much family and I lost a lot of people when I was diagnosed with cancer. He threw in my face that he wants children and I can‚Äôt provide that (this isn‚Äôt anything new) and when I said I was getting to a point in my health where I could start looking into options for how to have kids he said, ‚Äúeven if we could, is it smart to bring a child into this world not knowing if they‚Äôll have a mom around?‚Äù Not being able to have kids has been one of the hardest things that i struggle with, and he knows that and always reassured me that I was more important. I didn‚Äôt even know this person talking to me. So cold, empty. I feel so hurt because many times at the beginning of my diagnosis, I told him to leave me so that I didn‚Äôt have to drag him into this life and he always promised me he wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. He told me he‚Äôs not happy with his life and his priorities have changed and he doesn‚Äôt want to resent me. We never even argued. We were the couple people looked up to and my life collapsed around me in a matter of seconds. I‚Äôm having to tell people today and they‚Äôre not even believing it. Everything was perfect and then everything was gone. I don‚Äôt know how to live without him. I don‚Äôt even know how I can make this work. I‚Äôm so hurt and angry. Why propose mere months ago after 10 years just for this to happen? How can you just leave as things were getting okay and after I had everything in my life already ripped away with cancer and was trying to figure out how to rebuild and finally have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life? I haven‚Äôt slept, I can‚Äôt eat. I‚Äôm scared of what I might do when reality sets in. I‚Äôm going to die alone. Nobody wants to be with the amputee with cancer and I‚Äôm devastated. My self esteem has never been lower. I can‚Äôt have kids. I‚Äôm going to die alone. And a part of me wishes my cancer was bad again and it would take me sooner so I don‚Äôt have to do this anymore. I‚Äôm so over these cards I‚Äôve been dealt. I had a 20% chance of still being alive in March, and he won‚Äôt be there by my side.

I've had a meth addiction for quite some time now. A few hours ago, I ended up buying some fake shit. Looked completely legit but wasn't.

This is definitely not the first time this had happened. Suddenly, I started laughing. Not just giggling, but full blown hysterical howls of laughter. 

How stupid was I for allowing myself to get ripped off after several times of it happening?? I could have done something useful with that money. So I just shook my head, smiling, and got onto another Facebook account and messaged him. I simply said ""We both know what you did, and it's alright. Karma will take care of it. Peace.""

274,"Recently learned that childhood friend never existed Hello. 

I recently learned that one of my few childhood friends never existed in reality - only in my mind. The realization came while I was looking through an old elementary school yearbook of mine and noticed that he wasn't mentioned anywhere. 

I remember him being one of my classmates in grades 2-4. We sometimes sat together at lunch and during recess. He didn't attend school very often - only 1-2 times per week and was sometimes gone for weeks at a time. He abruptly stopped coming to school altogether during 4th grade - I assumed that he moved away. 

After realizing that he wasn't real, I began to desperately search for any evidence to the contrary - other yearbooks, photos, etc - and found nothing. I'm now confident that he never existed. 

In hindsight, the fact that he only talked and interacted with me  (and none of the other children) should've probably raised red flags of some kind - but, I never made the connection until noticing his absence in all of my yearbooks a few days ago.

I'm currently receiving treatment for bipolar disorder and what my doctors believe to be schizophrenia as well. I plan on bringing up this realization during my next appointment with each of them. 

Have any of you people had a similar experience - where you realized that a significant portion of your life wasn't real? If so, how do you cope with that realization?

I'm 26 and during my entire life, my parents have yelled and screamed that mental health, more specifically anxiety and depression, wasn't a real thing. They often dismiss anything that they don't want to accept, anything that might be a real issue. I wasn't allowed to go to a therapist, even when the school counselor brought me in almost weekly (mostly in middle school) to talk about well, anything. They were just trying to get something out of me but I often thought I was in trouble and didn't really understand why I kept getting taken out of class. 

So I've been struggling with my demons my entire life, looking for ways to cope, most of the time it was through drugs/alcohol, but I've cut down on that a lot. A close friend of mine has repeatedly told me over and over that I need to go talk to a therapist, and he's tried to convince me that I'm not crazy because I need help. Over and over and over again I told him that I didn't need to, I was fine, I just need to vent sometimes. I guess though, after my last episode a couple days ago, I was going on and on about how I just wasted my whole life, how I keep wasting time, how I don't have a direction, how I'm afraid to leave, how I'm afraid to act on things, how I'm indecisive, etcetcetc and he just flat out told me again that I really really need to seek someone out and it's not because he didn't want to help, he just doesn't know how to get to the root of my problem.

After some extensive research, I found a really nice counseling office right by my house. The counselor has a therapy dog too! My first appointment is on January 2, right after I get out of work. I'm stoked, but I'm also really intimidated and fearful that maybe I'm expecting too much out of this. Here's to hoping for the best and a bright future.",1

284,"3yo Survives On Bread And Butter For 4 Days After Mum Kills Herself At Home This is a terrible and disturbing story.

[]()

Short Story: She has 2 kids. 1 was with the dad. 1 was with her. She texts her mom to come get her daughter because she is about to end it. Mom says, ""Don't be daft."" She hangs herself. 3yo struggles to survive on her own on bread and butter for 3/4 days before she is found. Mom says there were no signs of mental illness. Friends say they just wish she would have reached out for help.

She did.

Desperate people do often reach out for help. They either are not taken seriously, or... the person is uncomfortable and doesn't know how to help so they say stuff like, ""It'll be okay. Be positive. etc etc"" Don't be crying at the funeral saying you had no idea when you have messages in your inbox that say otherwise. For anyone that reacts to this story by saying, ""I could NEVER do such a thing with my child present."" Consider yourself blessed/lucky/fortunate. Congrats, you've never had to experience that desperation and lowness.

\*\*\*\*\*If someone reaches out to you, PAY ATTENTION!!! And get them help for God's sake. Professional help. Immediately. Go to their house right away. Take them to the Dr/hospital. You are too far away or can't make it? Call someone that can. No one else can? Call 911. It is an emergency. Treat it like one. Would you rather them be pissed off at you for a few days because you sent them to the hospital or dead? Your choice.\*\*\*\*\*

It doesn't have to be this way. If we would just accept the fact that your mind is part of your body and should be medically treated just like the rest of it, we wouldn't see this as much. The stigma on mental health is still present and strong as ever. Depression is seen as weakness instead of illness. You can't fix your kidneys on will power and positive attitude alone and you can't fix the chemicals in your brain that way either. Grow up. People should be comfortable seeking help and being treated without judgement. In fact, they should be ENCOURAGED to get help. Yes, even by people who don't understand it. You don't have to understand how cancer works to support someone through treatment. You just have to be a caring human.

287,"RIP Desmond ""Etika"" Amofah, 1990 to 2019, a YouTuber and Twitch streamer who killed himself. For those who don't know who Etika is, he is a YouTuber and Twitch streamer who amassed a following of 800,000 fans. He's known for playing and commentating on Nintendo games with his electric personality, which fans loved him for.

Last October, he began to publicly struggle with his mental health by self destructing his YouTube channel and, on this site Reddit, made references to suicidal ideation. On April, New York Police detained Etika and sent him to a mental hospital after another threat of suicide in his apartment and also calling himself a ""god"" or ""antichrist"" on Twitter. On May, he had a altercation with a security guard, which again sent him to a mental hospital.

Last week, Etika posted a suicidal video titled ""I'm sorry"" apparently saying goodbye to his fans, in which YouTube took down. ""It was fun life"" he said, ""I had a great time. It was great. But for it to be cut so short- it's fucked."" Ever since the video was posted, friends and family were unable to contact him. Also the video was film in the daytime but was uploaded on midnight. One fan, Investigated his path he was walking when he filming his video, started from a freeway ending at Kingdom Mall very close to the Manhattan Bridge. The fan then posted his results on Twitter.

Few days ago, Etika's belongings were found on the Manhattan Bridge and today his body was found and confirmed dead. 

I wanted to post this as I thought this was a good subreddit to post to and took the opportunity to post it. I did not want it mentally harm any of people who asking for advise on this subreddit. I just post this just to remind you that mental health really really needs to be taken seriously, as Etika's mental health wasn't.

Those questions seem to really point towards making sure they are recruiting people who think ""normally"". Now I know, it's a job application and most people lie, and maybe everyone should lie to ""give them what they want to hear"". Personally though, I don't like lying, I don't want to present myself as someone I'm not. But from question one you can tell, those questions are really targeted. Some questions could be symptoms they copy/pasted from the DSM-5, with a scale from agree to disagree. It's really, really annoying at this point.

If I work in customer service, why do you need to know how I feel about life? Why do you need to know my level of motivation towards a specific non work related aspect of existence? Why do you need to know if I'm a happy person in my personal life? Why do you need to know if I'm a manipulator? There was like 10 questions about that, which I found so odd. Ask me about how I handle stress. How I handle fast paced work environments. Ask my about my empathy level. Ask me about my problem solving skills. If you want to ask things more personal, just have a text box and ask people to list their diagnosed illnesses. Would be much easier for both you and me.",1

Every day I hear comments from people I have trusted, who use what I have told them to further prove whatever negative point they have against me. I overshare, so it's really all my fault. Still. Some examples:

\- Telling a coworker I trusted about being abused as a child (because they were, too and they brought it up first). Few weeks later, he brought up the fact that I was abused as the reason why I am ""oversensitive about everything"" in the middle of an argument with other coworkers involved.

\- Admitting to a coworker that I am very sensitive about certain topics (he was involved in the argument mentioned previously). Telling the same coworker that I struggle to approach some people and some people find it hard to approach me because I don't understand social queues (I did frankly ask him and someone else what I should do to come off as more friendly). Few weeks later, he brings up a topic I have an opinion on that he doesn't agree with. He uses the fact that I'm hard to approach and clueless about social skills, to justify not wanting to talk with me, after getting angry at me for having a different opinion than his.

\- Telling a coworker that I have depression (because she had it too, allegedly and she brought it up). I also once told her that I feel like many people dislike me in the office. Today, I was dealing with a very upsetting situation and I couldn't focus on anything but what was going on. I was in tears and fighting suicidal thoughts all day. Coworker let me know that she will leave the company. I wished her good luck and good success in her future plans. She got mad at me for not being more inquisitive about her decision, and used my depression and the fact that I feel isolated (her words: ""Everyone is against you"") as a reason why I'm not nice for not being more excited and curious about her life.

I'm only gonna mention those since I think those coworkers won't see this so sorta anonymous, but it happens at home too, and in my relationship too. All the time.

So please, save yourself. Don't bother sharing anything with anyone. They will eventually use it against you. Keep it all for yourself, share with random strangers on the internet you won't ever engage in a conversation with, or talk to a paid professional.

Have a good night.

In other words whatever happens you can always affect how you want to experience and percieve it, as long as you know that you can.
This doesn't mean that you can make a traumatic event into a wonderful experience, but you can make a conscious decision to focus on another point of view that's less painful to bear with.

We also don't ***do*** anything together - we never go places or partake in sports or adventures. They are content to sit at home in front of the TV in silence. I've made many attempts to change this but it falls on deaf ears. It's isolating and it's boring.

I remember being so desperate for attention as a child but being dismissed because, for example, dad was too busy reading his book or mum was too busy cleaning. It was like they just couldn't be arsed. I was repeatedly told to go and amuse myself instead of bothering my dad in particular, who was very stoic and always has his mind elsewhere. Family holidays consisted of driving for hours in complete silence. If anyone broke the silence my dad would roll his eyes and become very irritable. He just kind of hated talking to us. So I became very used to this and learned to just stay quiet. I've struggled with social anxiety a lot as an adult, I think because I was brought up to believe that talking a lot was bad. I was a very talkative and confident child, but over time that was kind of stripped away. Talking to people for a long period of time, consequently, feels exhausting and kind of ***wrong***.

I felt myself up loving every curve and dip and squish. I celebrated me. I finally felt like what it was to love myself. 
I got out of the shower and wrote a poem of sorts. While I was in the shower, I kept repeating the phrase she is good to some beat I made up in my head. She is good meant that my body was good and it was perfect. This poem is meant to be read to a beat. You can make one up like I did.",1

Instead of being concerned, mom yelled at me, threatened to kick me out, said a lot of mean things to me, said she wished she 
never made such child, that I'm ungrateful. I had an operation recently for a tumor that could've turned to cancer and she said that if she knew how terrible of a person I am, she would've let me get cancer.

The thing is I ran away because I couldn't handle the pressure of school anymore and I keep telling them I wanna drop out because I have no motivation to do anything , let alone study. 

They said I'm just lazy and stupid. I expected a little understanding. I told them I wanted to see a psychiatrist and my mom said she doesn't want to stay with a ""crazy"" person in her house. When I told her that a friend of mine went as well, she called both of us stupid.

Do I deserve all this? I understand I wasted their money with my tuition by failing a lot of exams and I would be wasting even more if I dropped out. I understand we are struggling with money. I understand it was stupid to run away and I don't act my age (22) but I told them I need help and they disregarded me. Do I deserve all of this? I love them, it wasn't my intention to hurt them.

337,"I'm a therapist - for anyone looking for a free, accessible, safe, supportive community where you can talk about openly about mental health (even if between therapy sessions), I offer this option Hi r/mentalhealth \- my name is Dr. Mick, and I am a couple & family therapist in the United States with a PhD in Human Development. I've lurked in this subreddit on my personal account for a long time, and I appreciate how supportive this community is and I fully endorse the mission of the mod team. You may recognize me from a recent [IAmA]() I posted last week.

I see a lot of posts on here that focus on trying to find some level of community and support for mental health, whether in the space between therapy sessions or otherwise. In part, I think this is because (I'm sure most of you will agree) there are very few spaces online (and especially in-person) where mental health can be openly discussed without at least the fear of stigma.

If you find yourself looking for a safe, supportive space where you can speak openly about your mental health & where you are free to remain anonymous, I would invite you to join me and my growing community at [\_mick](). Now, before you write this post off as shameless self-promotion, I invite you to consider the following:

1. The community: there is a tight-knit group that is able to engage with you and each other in real-time from the comfort of your own terms. This community (900+ followers) has proved to be an incredible source of strength, support, and encouragement for each other. They'd welcome you with open arms.
2. The stream is facilitated by me - a real therapist. Though I can't ethically offer professional therapeutic advice on-stream, I can answer mental-health related questions and provide general information and resources. I am open to any and all questions, and I also monitor the chat (along with a dedicated mod team) to make sure it stays safe and supportive. So far, there have been no issues with trolls or negativity.
3. There is a dedicated [discord]() channel that stays active when I am off-stream. Many have told me that they have appreciated the sense of community as well as the ability to pop in and out as they please.
4. It's free, and it's consistent. I have no expectation for donation or otherwise. You also don't have to engage if you don't want to - feel free to watch and lurk if that better suits you. I stream every night (with a few exceptions) for at least 1.5-2 hours. I start at 11:30pm Central Time, which I know is a bit inconvenient, but I pepper in bonus streams whenever I can.
5. If you like video games, you'll feel right at home.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to reach as many people as I can. My mission is to provide a platform where all of us can feel comfortable talking about mental health in a more familiar, accessible space. My channel seems to have helped many, and I hope it can help you too. Stop by - we'd all love to meet you :)

&#x200B;

I'm open to questions (an informal AmA, if you will) if you have any. I'll answer them if I am able (I cannot answer questions that solicit therapeutic advice).

&#x200B;

\*\*Note: I approached the moderators of this subreddit to ask permission to mention my stream, and provided my credentials to them. If a mod sees this, I would be more than happy to re-post the credentials or discuss this post. I do not intend to harm - I merely want to let people know this is available to them/ shares the mission of this sub-reddit.",1

359,"Why does the mental health system have to be so fucking hard to navigate if you have anything other than depression or anxiety? The amount of self advocacy needed to even get the right treatment is fucking ridiculous. Even just getting a proper diagnosis is an uphill battle. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety for years, but I had so many other symptoms that weren't explained by my depression or anxiety, and it was making my life fucking miserable because I wasn't getting any treatment for anything other than depression and anxiety. I felt completely hopeless because I was seeing a therapist who I was being completely honest with and taking my medication, but I still felt fucking horrible. I felt like I was doing everything I was supposed to do to get better but none of it was working. This made me extremely suicidal and my therapist ended up having me committed. I honestly though that I'd finally get a proper diagnosis there, but instead I got discharged the next day. Then my therapist referred me to an intensive outpatient program. At first I hated being there because it brought up a bunch of past trauma and that made me feel even more suicidal. It was at this point that I finally confronted my therapist during our next appointment and told her that I'm pretty sure I have something other than just depression and anxiety. I told her that I thought I had PTSD, and I told her about the flashbacks and the intense nightmares that I've been having for years, and I finally got an official diagnosis. It felt like a relief to finally have what I had been going through validated, but at the same time I felt angry because I had talked about these things in the past and nothing came of it. But whatever relief I felt was pretty short lived once I realized that I still had other symptoms that couldn't be explained by my diagnosis, and this realization made me feel hopeless again, because just when I thought that I had finally found the missing piece to my puzzle, I find out that I was missing more than just one piece. I don't even know why, but I decided to talk to the therapist at my uni and tell him about having been diagnosed with PTSD, and he asked me some questions and I said that I had been going to an intensive outpatient program 10 hours a week. He said that it was strange that I had been referred to one at the time when I had been diagnosed with only depression and anxiety. He mentioned that they're usually for people with personality disorders, and at that point I was just very confused. Since I was seeing my psychiatrist the next day I decided to bring this up, and she ended up testing me for borderline personality disorder and it turned out I had it. She then sent out an application for me for a DBT group to go to once I finished the intensive outpatient program. I sobbed because of how scared I was of this diagnosis, but the more she described it, the more sense it made that I actually had it. Getting properly diagnosed felt like I finally had a full explanation for all the horrible things I'd been feeling for years, and I could finally get the proper treatment I needed to actually get better. I just hate that I had to go through all of this just to get diagnosed correctly so that I could finally get treatment that would actually help me.

Alot has to do with my wife trying to kill herself a few years back. I was stupid to think I could handle all that without seeking any help. It has basically ruined my marriage. My wife barely talks to me because of my blow ups I've had in the past.


Today I woke up and told myself I was taking my life back. I hiked up a local mountain today in santa rosa ca to prove to myself I could. It felt so freeing to know something that I've always wanted to do is now done. Tomorrow I call a psychiatrist to set up a meeting. 

For the sake of my, and my wifes marriage I will do this. Even if she does end up leaving, I need to do this for me.

Here's to new lifes, and strong beginnings, amd a hopefully brighter future.


Update: Thank you for all the support and kind words. She basically told me yesterday she wants a divorce, and I said ok. I am not for it, but if that's what she needs then I stand by her decision.  When I said I'll get the papers started ( she doesnt drive, has no license, no car) she started breaking down.

I stood by this woman for years of drug (benzo) abuse. Black outs, passing out on the couch that I had to carry her to bed. Begged her to see someone, helped her set it up, drove her there, supported her through the whole thing. And this is what I'm left with. 

There were so many times through that time that I'd wanted to leave her. But I stood by her side through it all. Because that's the kind of devotion a SO should do. All my hard work, patience,  and dedication with our marriage is now ending. 

I am still doing it for myself...",1
365,"If You Have A Mental Illness, DO NOT Smoke Weed Without Your Doctor's Approval Smoking weed to distract yourself from your problems is very similar to putting a band aid on a cut. It does not heal the problem you are having. That statement doesn't change the fact that these things have beneficial uses. The difference between the two is that one can prevent infection, and the other can amplify your enjoyment of your surroundings, and with almost no notable cause of harm to physical health, but you probably already knew those facts. What should be noted is that there is another similarity between band aids and marijuana. In some cases, you can be allergic to both. Now, I'm sure that someone can be physically allergic to marijuana, but the allergy I'm referring to with weed is mental in nature. Almost everyone I know who smokes weed has had an occasional bout of Anxiety, and that's pretty normal. But some people smoke weed and it causes Panic Attacks, and at it's worst, can trigger Psychosis. This isn't the medical definition, but long story short, Psychosis can cause Hallucinations and you can very easily believe these Hallucinations to be real. Without getting into detail, I can confirm on a personal experience that Marijuana has on multiple ocassions caused me to have bouts of Psychosis, and on one particularly bad instance, endangered not only my life, but the life of a loved one as well. Before this ever happened, I was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, and at no point did my Doctor ever prescribe or even recommend weed. In fact, she discouraged me from more than ever dabbling with it. Of course, being the average young adult that I am, I didn't listen, because the majority of friends smoke weed, because a lot of people I know smoke weed daily to cope with Anxiety and Depression. I did it because everyone is doing it. Not to sound like your parents, but if everybody jumped off a bridge, would you? If you smoke weed to cope with suppressed emotions like Depression or Anxiety, you need to let your Doctor know that. They need to know you are struggling, and they need to know if you ever had a Panic Attack or Anxiety on marijuana. Marijuana does not cure mental diseases, it merely provides the potential for distraction. When a doctor prescribes Marijuana, it is because it's a lot healthier on your physical body than probably any other drug they could prescribe you to deal with distraction. The Doctor has determined that with your Mental Illness, you will NEED distraction to help cope with it. Distraction is not inherently a bad thing, but it certainly is when you are distracting yourself from being safe.

tl;dr: Smoking Weed can be a good thing for people with mental issues, but only when a Doctor recommends it's use.",1

Anyway, I love my daughter. She's so sweet and cute and as perfect as a person can be in my eyes. But I am so unfit to be her mother. 

I was 18 and still a senior in high school when I had her, and I did not want to be a mother at all. But I live in a small, Christian conservative town and getting an abortion while still dependent on my parents would not have been possible. They and all of my doctors talked me into keeping the baby, even though the father had been abusing me. As soon as I had our baby, he left. 

I had been diagnosed with depression long before I gave birth, and after I had her, it got worse. At one point I stopped cleaning and feeding myself for days at a time. I now have a diagnosis of BPD and my mental health is tanking. I can't afford proper mental health treatment so I just silently suffer through it. I love my daughter but I don't even feel like her mother sometimes. There's times where I feel like I have no escape and I do think about killing myself, but then I realize it would be selfish of me. But I have attempted before and it's done enough damage to land me in the hospital, but not enough to actually kill me (obviously). 

It's hard to juggle a job, money, mental health and a child. Some days I feel higher functioning than others, but lately I can hardly function bc I'm so overwhelmed. I don't know what to do. I'm not sure what I'm really expecting by typing all of this out, but I at least need to get this off my chest. I feel like a shitty human and a shitty mother.

Edit: Wow, you guys are amazing. I didn't expect to come back to so many helpful and supportive responses. I am reading everything you guys are telling me and weighting all of my different possible options to better myself and do the best thing possible for my daughter. I wish I could reply to all of you, but there's just so many responses like I said. Which is a good thing.

369,"I want to tell you all about how much exercise is helping my mental health Hi. I (25f) have suffered from debilitating depression for several years. I noticed it correlated with me quitting the swim team when I went to uni aged 17. I spent most of that year hiding in my dorm room, in bed, not speaking to anyone. For years afterwards I behaved similarly, or went through phases of deep depression where I'd do the same. I've just started exercising again these past two weeks (running and swimming) and honestly feel like I've had a new lease of life. 

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, depression is way more complicated than just ""go for a run and you'll feel better"". Depression is soul sucking and anyone who has suffered from it knows how bad it gets. Some days getting out of bed just isn't an option. But when it's possible, I really advise going out for some exercise. Even if it's just for five minutes, then back home. Baby steps. I began by going for long walks - and one day I just broke into a run spontaneously. I ran for only a couple of minutes, but noticed the rush it gave me. It was a sense of accomplishment mixed with the natural high exercise tends to give people. Then, the next day I did the same thing. Over a couple of weeks I've gone for a long walk every evening. Some days I'll run as part of the walk, others I won't. But I've built up my fitness a little bit, and am now able to run for 10-15 minutes with short breaks. I also went swimming last week with a friend. The great thing about this is it gives me something to focus on every day, a sense of purpose and a goal. I'm currently unemployed and moved back with my parents (finishing uni and need to find a job). 

&#x200B;

The aim is, once I get a job, I'm going to incorporate a short run into the morning routine - run/walk for maybe 20 mins, shower, get ready for work. Hoping it will set me up mentally and physically for the day. Ok, so it's not fool proof and there will be bad days, but overall I think it really helps.",1

371,"For the first time ever, someone validated my trauma. TL;DR: I was bullied in highschool intensely. New therapist thinks it's trauma and I think she's right.

So basically all through high school I was relentlessly bullied by people I thought of as friends. They would constantly put me down and tell me to kill myself or make fun of me for being gay. My brother (who was also in this group) always told me to laugh it off because ""it's just a joke. Why can't you take a joke?"", Despite the fact I repeatedly asked them to stop. I felt like I couldn't leave them because they were my friends and I wouldn't be able to make new friends.

Fast forward to now, 2 years after graduating and I've cut them out of my lives ( although I can't avoid them because my brother still hangs out with them) and I go to an intake appointment for a new therapist. We go through the usual questions about drugs and diagnoses, and then she asked if I'd ever experienced trauma. Of course I said no, because I've always justified the bullying, but I ended up mentioning it as an after thought. And she told me that it sounded like trauma. 

I always thought trauma was for people with more ""serious"" issues but I think she's right. This bullying has basically defined how I view relationships now. I feel I have to prove myself worthy of them because I wasn't worth anything to my bullies. I feel like I have to test my friends to see if they really love me because in highschool my ""friends"" did not.  

Anyway, I finally feel ready to accept this issue instead of suppressing it. I'm sorry for the long post.",1

374,"My depression makes me not want to be around people, but that also makes my depression worse. Lately, I haven't been wanting to be around people at all. I'm pretty introverted even on my good days, but on my bad days, I just don't want to be around anyone. My parents and boyfriend have been my biggest supporters and really hold me together. I love them so much and would truly do anything for them, but on my bad days, I really just nothing to do with them. I don't want to talk to them, see them, or even think about them. I just want to be in my own bubble, and I know that habit of just not wanting to interact or be around anyone is going to be really detrimental to my mental health. 

Not being around people makes me sad too. It makes me feel lonelier and my only company is my thoughts. It's this endless cycle of wanting to be with people because I know I'll be sad otherwise, but also just not wanting to be around anyone. 

Has anyone experienced this? Like this conundrum doesn't really make sense at all. How did you create a balance between socializing and giving yourself some time?

375,"Why Being Mentally Ill Is Harder Than Becoming a Navy Seal 

Right after becoming a Navy Seal I had my first manic episode. All that training on mental toughness and still I wasn't prepared for the agony of losing my mind. At the time of my breakdown I was helping a former seal commander brainstorm strategies for a book called the Unbeatable mind. Turns out my mind was beatable. I experienced the seal selection process just a few months before spinning out in a psych ward, perhaps giving me unique perspective on the two difficulties. Let me say one thing: if you are living with severe mental illness, you are as tough as a Navy Seal.

The navy and hellweek pushed me, but I was surrounded by friends striving toward the same goal. In training we accomplished tasks together, never being allowed more than a few feet from your swim buddy. For miles we carried inflatable boats on our heads to learn to move as a single unit. We were grouped together into things with names like ""unit"" and ""squad"" and ""boat crew"". You always had a friend nearby.

But you go through delusions alone. You hear voices and see faces alone. I was locked in a psych ward for weeks, sometimes in restraints. Lost in my own mind and more frightened than I've ever been. All of this alone. Mental illness, like death, is faced alone no matter how many confidants you have. 

Preparing for BUD/s I set an informal world record for doing 3,000 burpees in seven hours. Find it on YouTube. I swam for hours out in the ocean and ran with a weight vest for miles and miles. Nothing in selection was gonna shake me. Hellweek they kept us awake for a week with endless suffering. Constant hypothermia, running until your toenails fall off, collapsing from exhaustion. We started selection with 260 guys determined to be seals. After hellweek we were down to 46. Almost all of them quit. Out of 80 guys in my boot camp class, I was the only one to graduate Bud/s the first try.

All that suffering and subsequent victory in selection and still totally sideswiped by mania. There is nothing that can prepare your spirit for mania. It is absolute chaos. It's left me swinging from rafters above a two story drop. It's left me jumping out of cars. It's left me naked one time and covered in paint another. And that's what's going on on the outside. Inside my mind I am surrounded by demons and conspiracies and brutal cosmic pain. In my mind I am followed and hunted like an animal by powerful government forces.

We suffered in Bud/s. We suffered in hellweek. But hellweek suffering never made me want to step in front of a train like mania or severe depression did. 

 On graduation day when I got my trident they threw a big party for me at the beach. Everyone I knew was there. After the beach party we went to the bar and my friends threw me in the air over and over above the dance floor. It felt like the pinnacle of my life. When I was forced out of the seal community for being bipolar I was mocked and laughed at, literally. Another seal, who at one point would have given his life for mine, spit at me. I slipped into a cage of shame and wanted to die. It took years to recover. 

Everyone seems to think it's badass to have survived seal training. But no one has ever told me I was a badass for surviving a mental illness. Well fuck, they should. 

The bipolar and schizophrenic people out there deserve medals but instead they wear the shame you force on them. This isn't a mental health crisis, it's a type of genocide. You all are killing us with shame. 60% of those living with mental illness didn't receive treatment in the last year (NIHM). Shame drives the decision making process for many of these people. It took me three years from when a doctor told me I was bipolar until I could convince myself to take a pill. Three years and another manic episode. That pill saves my life every day and I was too scared to take it. Too scared people would call me crazy.

In BUD/s I was a top 3 swimmer, top 3 on the obstacle course and a top ten runner. I was smooth on dives and not bad on an M4. I had so much to be proud of. That didn't stop me from wanting to end my life only months later. The ridicules and laughs and silences echoing in my head. The times people couldn't stop looking at me. The times no one was looking at me. It almost crushed me. A navy seal brought to his knees by mental illness. I went through arguably the toughest military training in the world and I barely survived mania and depression. 

Over 20 American Veterans kill themselves everyday (VA Study). That's a far greater death rate than any of our current wars. One without medals and gunfire yet still able to massacre. Secret battles inside the minds of our finest. 

90% of suicides are linked to mental illness (American Journal of Psychiatry). If you are fighting a battle in your mind and don't know anyone with the capacity to hear your story, please, please email me at 

I don't have any wisdom on how to heal from mania or depression. Sometimes I think you just survive the rough parts, like BUD/s. I travelled around the world trying to shake everything off and it didn't help. I hammered down drugs and collected lovers but I was still dead inside. The only thing that helped some was sharing my story with others. I first started telling strangers, people I'd smoke a cigarette with on the corner as it was easier that way. 

Life slowed down as I moved onto a sailboat and started spear fishing a lot. Being in the water helps me meditate. Eventually I met a girl who loves every part of me, even the crazy parts. I think it's one of the greatest human fears to think we cannot be fully seen and fully loved. But until you are seen fully, how can you be loved fully? Be brave enough to speak your narrative, even the shitty parts. It took me years to do this. I used to weep without hope but I know happiness now.

Happiness feels different on the other side of such pain. It's softer and quieter but somehow more real. I wake up early and often create with my hands. I look people in the eyes when I speak to them. I have been to hell and back and I am unafraid. I will fall again, but I will rise. I will be beaten, but in the end I will prevail. I am bipolar but I will stand tall. My head is bloodied but unbowed.

It really is amazing how much Facebook tries to guilt trip you into staying, such as highlighting ""friends"" that are going to miss you if you go away, or making you click through multiple pleas when you check boxes about why you're deactivating.

378,"The statement ""it gets better"" is not helpful. This notion needs to be replaced with ... so often people say ""it gets better"" in the effort of trying to be positive and supportive and helpful. It's bullshit. The real truth is that nothing gets better, you just get stronger. THAT is something to be proud of, that can help you push forward, that statement is helpful and hopeful.   


There are things I'm dealing with now, that years ago would have crippled me. Now, yeah it still hurts and it sucks and I'm depressed and struggling but I'm fucking surviving because I've grown and gained skills and learned that I can survive things because I am fucking strong.   


I think a big part of feeling hopeless and suicidal isn't necessary the idea that nothing good will ever happen to you ever again, but moreso the the idea of always feeling weak and powerless and not in control of things. That's fucking depressing and no wonder a person would want to quit on life. But being able to adopt the mentality of ""I can handle whatever comes my way"" gives you the power and control back. The more you go thu, the more you grow.

I feel this way when \_\_\_\_\_ happens (this part is the objective trigger, key word ""objective"". To stay with the above example, saying ""you called me a liar"" is much different from saying ""you attacked me"".)

I am feeling nervous and hopeful.

I feel this way when I share an explanation of the check-in format.

I feel this way because I think my words may not be effective or helpful. However, I also think that I have a responsibility to share ideas that may help people fix their problems even when their lives are largely out of my control.

What I notice in my body is shallow breathing and a bright energetic sensation in my chest and throat.

I choose to respond by letting go of my attachment to other people's actions and just share the idea.

\--------------------------------------------------------

Of course, nobody really expresses themselves exactly like that. But any thorough discussion about your feelings will have those elements in some form or another.

395,"""Vaginismus is one of the last remaining sexual taboos - and it's destroying people's lives"" Hi everyone - I'm a journalist with the BBC, and today have been the first filmmaker there to ever make a film about vaginismus.

If you've not heard of it, it's a psychosexual pain disorder in women; it's an involuntary contraction of the pelvic floor that makes any kind of penetration - that's sex, tampons, pap smears - impossible and horrifyingly painful. It's both mental and physical, meaning that it's not easy medicine and can take time to treat - but it IS curable, with therapy. 

It can have devastating consequences on people's lives, hopes and also dreams of having a family. It's believed to have a prevalence of 1-7% worldwide - that's A LOT of women! Chances are you know someone who has it. But taboo around sex often makes it really difficult for women to approach doctors about it or talk to friends/family members, and as I found in my report, most doctors don't have the training to adequately treat sexual problems (!). Even in the UK, that's supposed to be a world leader, I found only 13% of gynecologists feel like they have the right training to treat sexual problems.

We all know about dysfunctions like erectile dysfunction, but shame and stigma have meant that conditions like vaginismus have gone unspoken about in the media and untreated. With this little film I hope I can be part of a step forward in changing that. I've written a [thread]() about my film too, but here's a link to the short film below. Let me know what you think about it!

5 years ago I was an alcoholic, I was 19, and I was ready to die. I chugged my beer, threw the can to the ground, and was prepared to jump. At that moment I was under a campus investigation, didn't have my iphone, and used my little walmart flip phone to call suicide hotline. I cried and explained to them that I shouldn't be bothering them with this shit. That they had other people who were actually worth saving. Month later, i was transferring schools, and was finally admitting i was an alcohlic. well... it actually took waking up after a night of binge drinking, black-out driving, drinking tobasco sauce, and shitting myself in my friends basement to realize that i was an alcoholic. Over the next few weeks I convinced myself a few beers would be fine and wound up drunk driving to my parents and telling them that I had lied to them for almost a full year about how much I drank. I went to my new school, blacked out once more, and called my parents and told them I was too weak to quit. The next week I was in therapy, I was in AA, and I was ready to try out life. Later my girlfriend of 4 years on and off decided to cheat on me 2 hours before I arrived at her campus (a 15 hour bus ride). I found out because i saw over her shoulder she was sending nudes to him while next to me. I stayed sober through this, entered a new abusive relationship with a girl that hit me, told me she would kill me, and often told me i was the abusive one (i never laid a hand on her or even called her a name for that matter... how can i make someone else feel lesser when i was ultimately worthless in my own head). Nonetheless, I got out of that relationship, decided that waking up in physical pain from depression wasn't normal anymore, went on anti-depressants and ADHD medication, and moved on with my life.

Today, I am 5 years sober, I am in a LOVING relationship, I have a good finance job, and I am looking to make a difference in this world for everyone who may be struggling.

Then I got a call from one of my friends, in the only social group I count as friends, asking me if I want to go with them.

I still want to hurt myself either by cutting or burning but I'm holding myself together. I still wear a mask and appear calm around people, never speaking about it honestly. It will go away soon, I know myself, it's temporary. I just want to make this one through without scarring the same place again.

403,"22 year old who suffered social anxiety his entire life. I finally conquered it. Had trouble making friends, holding basic conversations, feared to be the center of attention, constantly felt like a person I was talking to was reading my mind when we made eye contact, could not stay in the moment, my mind filled with insecurities and negative ""voices"" every waking moment. Let's not even mention trying to approach girls.

After trying out different things and working hard on it the past 5 years, I finally got over what I thought I'd be stuck with the rest of my then miserable life. I wish someone was there to tell me how to go about managing and curing SAD when I was still young and had plenty of opportunities ahead of me, that I then missed because of my illness.

I decided to help others who are still struggling and are unable to reach their full potential because of it. I want to help you skip over all these years I had been trying to figure out what's wrong with me and then how to fix it. I always dreamt about helping people with this affliction as I know how difficult and how miserable it makes your life from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep day after day.

After thinking about it for a while I decided to start my own website with various content (articles only for now - might expand in the future) about my experiences, summaries of the information and scientific papers about sad, depression and mental health, in general, I read over the years and ways of managing and ultimately crushing it.

The website is called []()

This is the first time I've decided to write and post publicly so your feedback would be extremely welcome. If you like any of the articles please let me know, and if you want to see more and on any specific topic shoot me a PM or comment here/on the website and I will see what I can do.

Enjoy and stay strong my friends. There is light at the end of the tunnel, I promise.",1
404,"I keep remembering embarrassing episodes from my life and it's making me physically twitch I was just wondering if there are other people suffering from this.

Basically what happens is that I remember an embarrassing moment, like when I said something weird in front of a crowd of people, and my sense of embarrassment will get so intense that I physically twitch. When I'm lying in bed, it's like the motion you do when you're about to fall asleep and think that you're missing the last step of the stairs, that kind of thing. But it happens during the day too, and then it's more like suddenly pulling my arms towards my body. It's not really voluntary though I could probably suppress it. Nothing much more happens, e.g. I don't need to cry, hyperventilate, or anything like that. I have slapped myself during such moments, but not with the intention to inflict injury, more as a sort of energy release. After the brief instant that it takes me to make my nervous motions, I'm basically functional again.

This happens to me every couple of days at least, and sometimes several times a day. Part of it is that I can't seem to let embarrassing memories go. I think everybody has things that happened years ago that they're still ashamed of or embarrassed about (think r/blunderyears), but I'm not sure everybody has this intense a physical response to those memories. And remembering some episodes in particular just seems to send me into a downwards spiral of anxiety and embarrassment.",1

I wouldn't say I'm ""depressed"" in the typical way. When I work on stuff I'm almost manic in terms of energy because somehow I hope the faster and better I work the sooner my working shift will be over. I know this doesn't make sense, but I hope that one day I will be able to say ""Well, I did my job"". One day I want to say, even though I didn't enjoy life, even though I'm a worthless mentally ill piece of shit, at least I'm not a complete failure. Family would remember me as a weird crazy homosexual degenerate, but at least as one that had a higher education and income than anyone in our family at that time.

407,"The difference between PTSD and C-PTSD. PTSD is caused by exposure to a single traumatic event, such as robbery, military combat or a serious accident. With appropriate treatment, full recovery can happen.

Complex-PTSD typically occurs after prolonged, repetitive interpersonal traumas. These traumas build layer upon layer in the brain and body. 

Due to the nature of C-PTSD being rooted in events such as childhood abuse, domestic violence, it is often inescapable, especially for younger victims.

Unlike PTSD, C-PTSD affects the development of psyche and how we perceive the world around us. Recovery can be a lifelong journey, but there should never be shame attached. ",1

413,"Anxiety Attacks and Panic Attacks, they're not the same thing! After speaking with a client yesterday who wanted help for his ""panic attacks"" only to find out that what he was actually suffering from were ""anxiety attacks"", I thought I would try to explain the difference between the two. The two terms are often used interchangeably, in media and online especially, which is a mistake as they are actually very different in terms of their cause, experience and treatment. I know *Russel Brand* recently posted a video for ""panic attacks or anxiety attacks"" whilst only referring to anxiety attacks, also in the ""*Nadiya: Anxiety and Me*"" BBC Documentary, Nadiya referred to her attacks as panic attacks, although they were in fact anxiety attacks. All of this can be very misleading to people going through it and can prevent them from getting the right kind of help they need. Hopefully this post will help people understand which one they suffer from and thus help them to find the right treatment in order to recover. 

# Cause:

**Anxiety Attack**: A stressor in your life e.g. part of social or gen. anxiety, such as: money, the future, stress, relationships, ""what if"" etc. There is usually a clearly identifiable trigger for the attack. Often feels *""MORE MENTAL THAN PHYSICAL""*

**Panic Attack**: The fear of experiencing physical symptoms, either that you're already experiencing or fear experiencing again in the future. They are often described as happening ""out of the blue"" without a trigger (although the trigger is actually the fear of the physical symptoms themselves). Caused by misunderstanding and non-acceptance of the physical symptoms. NOT RELATED TO LIFE STRESS. Often feels *""MORE PHYSICAL THAN MENTAL""*

# Experience:

**Anxiety attack:** although they do include physical symptoms, the person is still ""panicking"" about the situation that got them into the attack e.g. the social situation that has given them anxiety, their money issue etc, and not the physical symptoms themselves. Person may feel like they have to leave certain social situation to calm down as that is what is causing it.

**Panic Attack:** this is always about the physical symptoms, there are several fears someone has with a panic attack but they are always linked to the physical symptoms, these are the most common: ""I'm dying/seriously ill and need to go to hospital"" ""I'm going ""crazy""/ I have ""schizophrenia/bipolar"" ""I'm scared of when they will come back"" 

# Treatment:

**Anxiety attack:** these are part of someone's current levels of social or general anxiety; therapy with a psychotherapist or similar where you can find the underlying causes and mechanisms that cause this anxiety to occur is best.

**Panic Attacks:** CBT therapy/Acceptance therapy/Panic Peer Recovery, the person needs to understand what is happening to their body and why, and then train themselves to fully overcome the fear of the physical symptoms and eventually they will stop. 

&#x200B;

Note: it is entirely possible to initially experience an anxiety attack that then evolves into a panic attack as the physical symptoms become so intense. I would suggest getting help for the anxiety as that is the initial cause.",1
414,"To those of you whose minds wont shutup at night So, if you're anything like me, you have those nights where your brain wont shut off. You start thinking about something stupid you did earlier, if someone misinterpreted something you said, about work problems, about the fight you had with a significant other/friend/family, maybe that exam that's tomorrow, or anything else. Well, I found a way to silence that. It might not work for everyone but if it can work for at least one other person, I'm happy.

Lay down with the lights off. Invision a piece of paper and a pen (feel free to get creative). Now, gather every single thought or topic you can't get out of your head and write it on that paper, creating a list. Take that list and now invision a candle/lighter/fire. Hold it above the flame and slowly watch it burn to pieces. Breathe. It does not exist any longer in this moment. Let it be nothing.

I suffer from PTSD and I have genuine triggers that make me have panic attacks so hard I lose time and memories or even lose control over my actions. I'm not alone in this. Please look up real life PTSD episodes and real life panic attacks - those are brought on by a trigger. Triggers are a real medical term. Because of this joke, I can't even use it within a professional setting without trivializing myself - and that's a reaction and self-view I cannot control.

I wish I could easily escape it, too,  many popular youtubers and bloggers use it. People I genuinely enjoy the humor of outside of those jokes. People who are known for being kind and open-hearted, just gutting all hope from me by flipping and defending use of triggers as a joke.

I know I'm not alone in this - many other adults suffering from PTSD can agree with me. I know some who might disagree, too, but they are well within their right to claim that because they also suffer from PTSD.

It's 's gotten so much for me. I've pretty much avoided all my favorite online users because  some point, it's ""haha i know it's a bit triggering"" or ""oh nooooooooooo triggerrrreeedd"" or ""im so triggered right now""

it's. too much to deal with. I know there is next to nothing I can do, and people who actively enjoy this ""joke"" will skim this, avoid it, or maybe try to ""defend themselves"" by getting upset with me... in that case, then this is just a rant post.

444,"I lost against my GFs depression and am so sorry... It's been more than 6 years. I just can't anymore. I know everything still looked normal from my end, but inside I was just crumbling for a long time. It's been so hard. So much energy lifting you up all the time whilst trying to do my work and take care of our home. 

I had to break it up... For so long I tried to be a better person for you, tried to get you excited about stuff, tried to understand when you couldn't leave home, when your anxiety and panic attacks got the best out of you. When you said you wanted to go out and then cancelled last minute because you felt unwell. For a long time, I really thought I could fight through it and get you in a better place.

But it's been so long... And the 'you don't understand me' and 'you don't help' broke my heart every time you said it. Because all that energy was all of the sudden being dismissed as something unworthy. I know depression is a selfish disease. I know you need to take care of yourself and it has to be you who gets you back up. But I always thought I could make a difference. I loved you and wanted to take care of you as much as possible and more.

For a while now, I haven't been able to feel happy inside. I was there for you and looked like so but that state seems so much like going towards a depression. I thought the Summer would make things better, with the extra sunlight. But not even that... Your day was divided into sleeping, time on the couch and working. I tried to have you exercise and eat better, but after all, you're the one who had to initiate that. 

And you didn't. And I know it's characteristic of a depression, but it's been so long now... I just couldn't anymore. And now you're heartbroken and so am I. For you, this came out of nowhere - it went from day-to-day normal life to nothing. Not because of something objective and defined, but because it piled up for so long. Because I wanted to be there for you and to be my best self for that. And the other day everything just became too much for me. I had to leave...

I was your first love and 6 years of it were so beautiful. I really loved you as well, we had plans for us, we wanted kids... But this was too much. I haven't been able to work, sleep or generally live normally for a while because of how much this takes away from me. I'm so sorry. You're heartbroken. You say you won't ever trust anyone. You say I didn't give us a chance. You say I'm like my father. And I know this was a one-sided decision, but I got myself somewhere I couldn't get out of. I need to be on my own. I need to find peace and regain energy and emotional stability.

You will get better. You will overcome depression. I know that - you're a beautiful intelligent person who will do whatever you want with your life. In a long term, I think we'll find peace and happiness again. But for now, it's just so hard to go through this and see you suffer like this... 

Please take care of yourself. I believe in you.

Always yours.",1

She was telling me how hard it was for her to have what she called an 'invisible disease'. How people would brush off the fact that she was sick because they couldn't see what was wrong with her. And how people would belittle the choices she would make to lessen her pain or tell her to get over it. I mentioned that I understood what that was like because of my depression.

I mean I have friends, the kind you rarely see every once in awhile, but I don't have any friends in the sense of friends that are involved in your life, or someone that wants to be part of your life. Almost all my friends are the Facebook kind. The kind that only keep up on an app.

I feel bad for my partner because she is my only outlet. I never see anyone, including my own family. My father has never been in my life. My grandparents have been long gone. I don't really have anyone. My stepdad only calls on holidays and that's it. Always telling me ""don't be a stranger"" even though I've made attempts to call.

I just feel like the only person I have is my partner. Anyone else feel the same? Anyone else wish they had others? I just hate that I don't have anyone here to go out to lunch with or anything. I've tried, but no one ever has time or gets back to me. I just feel like at times there is this aura around me telling others to just not waste their time.

I hate feeling this way.

I know this can be controversial with the amount of people that think weed is a harmless substance, and to some it is harmless but for me it wasn't. When I smoked a lot of weed i didn't want to do anything but lay in my room. Eventually I started getting depressed and felt like the worst of every situation was going to happen. Even if I had only a single f I thought I was going to fail everything in high school and was going to fail in life and make it no where just because of a single bad grade. I fantasized about killing myself all through out the day for years. But several months ago I stopped smoking weed and it was terrible the first month, I got no sleep for several days and after about a week when I did sleep it was only for a couple hours. About three weeks in I was managing to get full sleep but still was struggling. After about a month I was back to being completely normal. It's been several months now since I've quit and I love it, i feel like I've rediscovered who i was before i started smoking weed 4 years ago the true me. I'm not saying anyone should stop smoking weed but I do think if you smoke weed and feel depressed or suicidal then you should consider it cause it worked fantastically for me.",1

Hi all!

I just want to post here to say that I am finally getting therapy and I am so very proud of myself! I'm not being stubborn anymore. I have been neglecting my mental health for years in a strange way. Instead of seeking professional help, I've been trying to help myself by reading self-help books and articles on the internet. The only thing that did for me was inform me. Even though I've read about mental health, I've never actually applied anything to my life. If I did, it just drove me into a downwards spiral because it was like my own mentally ill mind talking to my own mentally mind. I didn't get very far at all.

I tried therapy once but stopped going within like two months because I had the hardest time opening up to my therapist. I couldn't get myself to be real with my therapist and slowly convinced myself that I didn't need therapy and I could do it myself.

Fast forward a year later and here I am, in the same place but maybe a little worse. Now I understand that I REALLY do need help. I need an extra hand. I need a listening ear. Mostly, I need GUIDANCE. I don't have anyone in my real life, and I most certainly have proved that I can't help myself all on my own. I also realize that I am in a blessed situation to even be able to get therapy, having insurance and all. Not a lot people can get therapy because of the costs when they really need it. Maybe I can get help and then help other people.

Anyways, instead of being rebellious towards the medical field when it comes to mental illness, I am at a breaking point where I just need to do it. I almost have no choice. I can't go forward like this. In fact I wouldn't be going forward at all. I am not getting better. I am getting worse. And I have nothing around me to help me, but I do have this choice, and I made this choice, and I am proud of myself for making this choice and sticking with it.

&#x200B;

Basically I just can't wait. I'm excited. I'm excited to feel better for me. I'm excited to have someone to talk to, someone who is a professional, someone who I can trust, someone who understands and can help me because I want help. I'm breaking out of the molding. Now is the time. Phew.",1

457,"Anxiety is... ""you have nothing to be anxious about"" 

""why are you freaking out? There is no reason for you to freak out""

People often think anxiety is caused by situations around them or you need a legit reason to be anxious. NO you can just be sitting and watching TV and have a meltdown out of nowhere. That is anxiety. Anxiety is a million voices in your head telling you you are not good enough. Anxiety is going from 0 to 100 and back in the span of 30 seconds. Anxiety is that suffocating feeling where you reach to a point where it hurts to breathe. A common advice people give is ""ignore it"" or ""try to be more positive"". You think I wouldn't ignore it if I could? You think I like thinking that the world would be a better place without me? Anxiety is when you lose control over your mind. Anxiety is the pain millions of people live with. ",1
458,"So you think you're making it up Deep down you just *know* that all these symptoms you experience are fake. That you are choosing to suffer, to let the smallest thing set you off, to be scared to death by a single bee. And you know you would be much better off if you would just stop, but you just can't seem to stop, like you're addicted to being a lazy winy coward.

This ideology is:

- Natural
- Inevitable
- **Completely False**

Here's what I have to say about this:

# Of course you assume you're the worst

Anxiety and depression are extremely common co-morbidities, so even if you don't have them, you likely have at least some of the most common symptoms, including having a poor self-image, and assuming the worst even if there's evidence disproving it. How likely do you think a person with those two symptoms would be to constantly worry that they're a fake? It becomes almost a paradox of a sort: the fact that you constantly worry that you choose to worry is proof that your brain is hardwired to constantly worry.

# ""But what if I really am making it up?""

I'm not a psychologist, so take this with a grain of salt, but remember that the brain will do whatever it takes to protect itself. For example, when we fall off a skateboard our natural instinct is to stretch out our arms so as to sacrifice them in the name of our head. As it turns out, rolling into your shoulders is much safer, including for the head, but it puts our head closer to the danger of the ground.

I feel it would be safe to assume that the same applies to inescapable thoughts: if you're driving yourself insane with the ideology that you're choosing to act a certain way, especially something like worrying excessively, an ideal brain would force you to stop those actions so as to prevent the insanity. But the actions keep happening anyways. Almost like it's not a conscious decision but rather the symptom of a chronic disorder.

# Your observations are very flawed:

- Your entire understanding of ""normal"" is your own experiences. Everything about you seems normal *to you*. Then this comes full circle when you try to determine how normal your life: By the symmetric property (a=b -> b=a), all of your experiences appear to be things everyone goes through!
- Everyone else hides what they go through as well. Especially when they also have, for example, depression. So two friends could both have depression and both mask themselves, hiding how they truly deal with things.
- To put it somewhat mathematically, we have source 1 which is calibrated against itself and source 2 which is indeterminately biased positive. We plot each pair on a graph, and manage to draw a best fit line despite the points being all over the place due to source 1 being essentially random. Next we take the data point that represents ourself, but without biasing source 2 upwards, and then find that we are below the line for some reason. In case you couldn't tell, that line is in no way accurate and should *not* be trusted.

# ""But society/my family keeps telling me so!""

Simply put: they're wrong. Just like how your understanding of normal is wrong, so is theirs. They don't really know what it's like to be you; their idea of how someone should act in whatever situation is based on their own selves. So what if you don't fit the arbitrary mold that society conjured? [Insert All Star lyrics]

# ""But my symptoms got worse after I learned more about my disorder!""

Really this essentially the ""doom-saying news problem"": Is the world getting worse or is the news reporting more? Yes, you do notice more symptoms. And in a way, yes, you're choosing to experience them. But that makes *two* ways that you've improved since learning more about what you have.

It's probably obvious why the first part is good. But keep in mind that you easily could have been experiencing those symptoms this whole time without realizing they were those symptoms. For example, I never listen to music in the car or at home, with minor exceptions for at home (mainly Nintendo music and Sheet Music Boss). The idea of choosing to listen to a radio while driving bewilders me. Apparently most people like it. Also I often favor an unplugged electric guitar when practicing music, even though I'd rather be playing my french horn. It's almost like I'm extra sensitive to sound... oh wait a second: Hypersensitivity is a major symptom of autism. And this has been going on long before I knew anything about ASD other than ""bad at making friends"" (in fact I just made the connection recently).

But you're probably mostly wondering why I called it a good thing that you're choosing to suffer.

At work I would have what I used to call ""good days"" and ""bad days"", and that's all I knew of them. Some days I go into work ready to work, others I would be unfocused and very stressed. Nothing bad happened the mornings of the bad days, just having a ""bad day"".

But sometimes, I would have a ""worst day"". These happened approximately monthly, and generally after a series of ""bad days"". On these days I could hardly work. I would keep trying with little success. It would generally start just after arriving, subside a little during lunch, but be even worse by the end of the day. Over time, I started having more and more bad and even worst days. The ""worst days"" eventually became almost weekly.

Once I learned more about autism, I realized those worst days were meltdowns! Now I take a completely different approach when this happens by stopping what I'm doing so I can cry a little or something. Now I haven't had a full meltdown since July. I'll still have those ""bad days"", but by letting them happen they last much shorter and rarely escalate to ""worst days"". **You're not choosing to suffer, you're choosing to let yourself experience natural symptoms.**

# ""But this person has it worse!""

So what if they have it worse? What if you went to the hospital for a broken leg, but someone else had two broken legs? The doctors might put a little more urgency on the other person, but you still have a broken leg which needs treatment. It's a spectrum, where each person falls into a different severity. [removed]

> One small correction: Down Syndrome is a spectrum. There are people with it that can live semi-independently, people with it that can live in supported accommodation, and people with it that need round-the-clock care. - u/vegancondoms

If anything, it sounds like a great opportunity for a strong friendship. You both understand how bad it is, or at least that you can't comprehend how bad it is. Also, saying they have it worse implies you *both* have it bad, just different severities.

# An interesting [conclusive] title

You're not making it up. Your problems are completely valid, even if you haven't been diagnosed (diagnosis is still strongly recommended). So don't beat yourself up over these symptoms that are simply not your fault.

Now if you'll excuse me I need to go beat myself up anyways because I posted something publicly. But if anyone has anything to add feel free to share it!

There is a lyric from Hamilton that describes what I was going through perfectly: there are moments when you're in so deep, it feels easier to just swim down.

The world was dark. I didn't think I could get out of it. I hated myself.

I wanted to die.

I sought out therapy, which I still go to. I found a psychiatrist, who diagnosed me with anxiety, depression, and OCD. I do behavioral-cognitive exercises and I take 100mg of Zoloft every day.

It took a while, but things got better. The world isn't as dark. I don't hate myself. I don't want to die anymore. The OCD is still there but it's WAY more manageable. I have even started cooking again!

There is no shame in needing help. There is no shame in needing antidepressants to function. There is no shame in taking care of your mental health.

In order to end stigma we have to understand that individuals are not their diagnosis. Instead, they are living with it. We need to educate ourselves in order to fully understand the complexity of mental health issues.

We are not self conscious, we are hurt. Life events caused us to develop anxiety.

We are not lazy, we are tired. Life events caused us to develop depression.

483,"Getting my cats was probably the best decision I‚Äôve ever made. I have had generalized anxiety since I was 7. Great home growing up, great parents. They were a little strict, but I appreciate that so much now as an adult. 

My dad was weird about pets, I don‚Äôt really know why. He grew up in Brooklyn and they only ever had one dog growing up, so maybe it just wasn‚Äôt a common thing then? 

I think the first time I asked for a cat was when I was around 7. My dad didn‚Äôt think I would be responsible enough for a pet, and my mom didn‚Äôt want a litter box. Fair enough. I think I asked for a cat every year until I moved out. We did get a dog when I was 10 (my mom rescued her), and she‚Äôs amazing!!! Cutest lil fluffy bear.

So I‚Äôm almost 22 now, and I adopted two kittens on Father‚Äôs Day.  I‚Äôm a college student and new pet fees can be steep. My local humane society had free adoptions that day, and I was like ‚Äúfuck it, it‚Äôs kitty time.‚Äù So I got two girls, sisters. They have honestly changed my life. They make me feel so happy, I feel like I‚Äôve smiled more in the last 7 months than I have in the last 7 years. 

I remember telling my mom that I wished I had a pet that loved me the way pepper (the family dog) loved her. Like, google eyes, snuggly, unconditional love. And now I have it!!! It feels like a really special connection. I try to give them lots of attention and learn their patterns and behaviors so I can understand them, and it feels like they know that. They‚Äôre angels. They don‚Äôt bite, scratch, or destroy anything. They will let you touch them anywhere, and even let us open up their mouth if we had to. 

It‚Äôs so nice to feel grounded. I feel like sometimes I get stuck in a bad place in my head, then a little kitty just jumps in my bed with me and it‚Äôs like I snap back to reality. 

If you don‚Äôt have a pet, I urge you to try to adopt! Obviously don‚Äôt adopt a furry friend if you can‚Äôt afford it or don‚Äôt have the time, but if you do, this is your sign. You‚Äôll save a pets life, and maybe they can save yours‚ù§Ô∏è",1

The past 5ish years have been pretty tough for me. I was diagnosed with ADHD, depression and Tourette‚Äôs (just facial tics thankfully). Many of my family members had passed away from many things ranging from cancer to freak accidents. Everything was getting to much. I felt numb all the time. I didn‚Äôt see a purpose to anything. I was convinced that my friends and family didn‚Äôt really care about me and we‚Äôre just putting up me which caused me to distance myself from them. I was too tired to do anything. I‚Äôve always been to some sort of psychiatrist but I was always too scared to tell them and my parents how I was actually struggling and then last January I decided that I couldn‚Äôt live like this anymore and so I told my parents that my mental health was getting worse and I couldn‚Äôt handle it. They immediately set me up with my psychiatrists who got me on new antidepressants and a higher dose of aderall along with some other shit to help my tics. After that I began working out and eating healthy which made me feel so much better. 

A few months later I started to notice that I was closer with my friends and family. I even started making new friends whom I‚Äôm super close with now! I also got a new job which I love. This is the first job I‚Äôve ever had that I actually connected with all my coworkers which is really exciting for me. My friends who‚Äôve I‚Äôve been friends with for awhile have told me that it‚Äôs very obvious that I‚Äôm doing way better. 

The past few weeks I‚Äôve just been so overwhelmingly happy with how far I‚Äôve come and I just felt like I needed to share",1
488,"Does anyone else feel as though awarness for mental health disorders is growing but only for certain disorders? I have noticed that over the last number of years there has been a growing, positive narrative on mental health, people genuinely are more aware of it but only when it comes to anxiety and depression. I feel as though other disorders e.g OCD and psychotic disorders are being left behind within the public narrative. It appears to me that psychotic disorders for example are still in the dark ages when it comes to public awareness. People are scared of people with psychosis and are not treated with the same respected / care by the public as someone with anxiety or  are feared by a large portion of the general public. Many people have ideas that they are violent which is completely not true. 

TL;DR: The public narrative about mental health is leaving certain disorders in the dark e.g psychosis and OCD unlike anxiety and depression which get most if not all the attention.

Today my anxiety was at an all time high. I‚Äôm about to start my senior year of Chemical Engineering school, I‚Äôm in a sorority and have two positions, I plan on keeping my job while in school to pay for everything, and I‚Äôm just overwhelmed with whats to come. I also struggle with what I call ‚Äúspiraling thoughts‚Äù where one self hating thought creates another, and another, and another until I‚Äôve created a whole situation in my head such as why my friends hate me and I should just disappear. Today, that got to me and I found myself tearing up at work and being upset. While I got my work done, I totally could have been more productive if I wasn‚Äôt so upset or self hating or overwhelmed. This has occurred a few times, but I always trudged through it and went to work even if I felt terrible and had to pull myself from my bed.

After I got home I still felt crummy and went to a friends house to talk it out instead of isolating myself (which is a big step for me in comparison to a year or so ago). She convinced me to take tomorrow off work because my weekend was full of sorority mandatory meetings and friend birthdays (stuff which I really don‚Äôt mind, but also don‚Äôt have any time to breathe). I just told my supervisor I felt not so great this morning, still felt bad into the evening, and wanted tomorrow off. Supervisor had no problem with it and let me off.

Now that I‚Äôm home in bed, I feel guilty for taking off. I know it will be good for me, but I feel like I should‚Äôve just kept going. Does anyone else struggle with this?

495,"My journey with antidepressants starts tomorrow, thanks in large part to my Dad. After a year or two of my depression getting worse I finally told my parents about it 3/4 weeks ago, my dad revealed to me he has been on antidepressants for the past 10 years, I had no idea. We had a long chat and he explained to me how he had been feeling and how antidepressants have helped him. When he was talking it was like he was completely reading my mind and saying exactly how I felt. 

Because of this I went to my doctor today and had a chat with him about it, and tomorrow I begin my ‚Äòjourney‚Äô to see if these are the right fit for me. I‚Äôm nervous but also excited about hopefully getting back to feeling more like myself and enjoying life again. 

Wish me luck !

502,"Named after my father and found out he Sexually assaulted my sister.... I need to tell my story, would you care to listen.....

So I'm in a depressed mental spiral. I'm a ""JR""  as well as the oldest of 5 kids, and growing up I was constantly told that I was just like my father in so many ways. From my looks, behaviors, mannerisms, and even joining the USMC. My father used to be my hero and idol growing up until I was 7 yrs old. That's when I noticed alot of shit, he would physically discipline me and my brother (2yrs younger) and it would be harsher when he was upset about other things. I think my mom could tell a lil bit and over the following years they went thru a divorce. But during that time he was more aggressive as time went on. 

After he left, he tried to preserve his image of a good father and fought for visitation. At this time I was around 10yrs old and he started dating again as well. His GF was a kind and loving woman who I befriended. They had two kids, first was my sister and then a 2nd brother, but after my brother was born my father suddenly disappeared and went all radio silent as I was about to begin HS and my teenage years. Fast forward to after graduation and just a few months before I left for Boot camp for the U.S. Marine Corps (18yrs old) and I get a msg via Facebook from his GF. She says that they wanted me to visit and be apart of their lives. So I decided sure, and when I found out not only did he remarry his GF, (wasn't invited to wedding) but I had a 2nd Sister as well and nobody mentioned it. Later on I made him promise to never put my siblings thru the pain that myself and my brother went through. He agreed, fast forward 10yrs and not only did he divorce again after cheating and break his promises, but he also convinced himself that he never made any promise and that I didn't know the full story. Yet he posts about his latest GF and praises her kids while ignoring his own. 

And then brings us to present day as I  my oldest lil sister (18yrs old) wanted to spend her spring break by my apartment just to relax and reforge our bonds that we had before i was absent for my teenage years in her life. We were extremely close and wanted that bond back. As we talked and talked, my sis told me that our father had not only groped her under her pants but had her do the same to him right before I came back into her life. I was so disturbed by this because I would kill for my siblings, especially my sisters if someone hurt them. 

But what disturbs me the most is that when she told me, there was a part of me that wasn't surprised. Reason is that before my parents divorced, I had heard whispers that my aunts (father's side)  were sexually assaulted my my father, but my grandmother didn't believed them because she could never see any wrong in my father. She was also the type who would openly say/show that I was her favorite grandchild because I was the 1st born and named Jr. 

My sister confided in me because I too was the victim of a sexual assault (from a woman) and knew i would understand her in some way. But knowing this know has triggered so much confusion as I am haunted but past voices who had always said ""You're just like your father."" 

I don't know if anyone out here has any similar experience but any advice would be helpful as I have been overwhelmed by negative emotions and intrusive voices while I wonder who/what I am. For a name is a powerful thing, but in my case it feels like a shackle that is cancerous to me.  (I live in Chicago IL, USA)


P.S. yes I have intrusive and suicidal thoughts but I have too many things that have been preventing me from going thru with it (Thank God), so please be at ease regarding that situation. ",1

I get that question a lot. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the worst thing you‚Äôve heard‚Äù. 

I could sift through stories. Fights, drama, drugs, weapons, gang violence. even some of sexual abuse in teen relationships. However, today, it was the worst. 

For extreme cases of truancy, we do truancy workups with our truancy officers and a school social worker whenever we find the family. 

I had an appointment at 1 for this truancy hearing. I look up the name in the computer, print out the basic information on this girl I‚Äôve never heard of. 

One of truancy officers for my school comes in. He tells me my appointment at 1 was cancelled. 

I get ready to call the parents. We can accommodate, we can go to the house, we can go wherever to have the meeting if the parent can‚Äôt make it to the school. 

The truancy officer tells me to ‚Äúnot worry about calling‚Äù and that the appointment is ‚Äúreally, really canceled‚Äù. 

I ask why. 

He informs me that he drove out to the house to be shooed away by heavily armed Homeland Security,  FBI, and state + local police. 

2 hours later, he gets an update. Our student was a kidnapped human trafficking victim from Canada, and the ‚Äúparents‚Äù were pimps. 

Then I learned soon after that when the police made entry to the house, a pimp tried to hold the girl hostage with a box cutter. He was shot in the face, the girl had her chin cut by said box cutter.

What I mean by this post is that ‚Äúmental health awareness‚Äù seems to only be for people in those categories of illness. And that is great! I am very honestly happy for you guys. I don‚Äôt want to put you down.

It just frustrates me that people try to champion awareness, but when I mention the severe symptoms of my own conditions, I am not met with the same welcoming response others get. ‚ÄúAwareness‚Äù is never for me. In fact, my campus has all these positive posters around but they are discriminating against me behind this fa√ßade. 

I find that the resources frequently given out for awareness events are not resources that can even help me. I have tried for years to find help, I have been to events, asked counselors, anyone. But these resources are not for me either. And that is also so frustrating. It‚Äôs been so difficult to find specific help for me and I deteriorate every day because of it.

Anyways, I just needed to vent about something that frustrates me a lot. I‚Äôm sure there are people out there with similar experiences. And please keep in mind what I am saying is a generalization, I know people with depression can struggle finding help too, every situation is different. I just want everyone to get the help they need.

While I was in crisis, I made the decision to open up to my students in class about what I was going through.  I felt they deserved to know why I wasn't performing up to my own standards.  The student response was overwhelmingly supportive.  I hadn't really expected that.  What was even more surprising, though, was the number of students who approached me about their own mental health struggles, thanking me for opening up.  I heard from so many students that it made them feel safe, really for the first time, to talk about their own issues and that they were grateful to see that they, too, could be successful even with mental health problems.

I honestly never suspected that so many students were struggling.  I assumed, as so many people do, that my problems were somehow unique, that I was all alone.  This experience, though, has convinced me that faculty need to be doing more--much more--to advocate for student mental health.  I'm not sure how to begin that conversation with my colleagues, but I'm determined to try.

No matter who you are, you have probably ‚Äúcrashed and burned.‚Äù 

Even the strongest of us can get overwhelmed with life‚Äôs sporadic emergencies, constant stress, and our own personal triggers.

Perhaps your work has been grinding you into the ground. Maybe a failed relationship has thrown your emotions into shambles. 

Or, you‚Äôre spending just a little too much time thinking about how life is meaningless (PS: The meaning of life is to give your life meaning. But that‚Äôs a talk for another time).

You need an immediate boost to get yourself back on track. 

Break out your emergency mental and physical health toolkit.

**I created a toolkit template filled with activities I consistently use to drastically increase my self-esteem, lower my anxiety and depression, as well as force my body back into healthy cooperation.** 

You can run through my program exactly, or use it as a jumping off point.

This will be a single day program. 

You can still work or take care of errands in between these tasks, but it would be ideal to take the day off or use this toolkit on the weekend.

## MORNING

**1.** Wake up at a reasonable hour. Only you know what this means to you, but do not sleep in. Conversely, do not under-sleep. This will drastically effect your mental health during the day. Find the sweet spot that makes you feel accomplished and rested.

**2.** You will be staying off social media and news websites for the entire day. Remove yourself from technology as much as possible, using it only for work.

**3.** Start the day with this breathing and movement exercise. This will lower your stress hormone, cortisol, which is high in the mornings:

**A.** Stand with your feet separated a bit wider than your shoulders.

**B.** Exhale and slowly bend forward with your arms crossed around your chest. Squeeze your hands into fists to relieve tension in the spine. Feel the muscles that are stretching, and rate your exertion between 1-10. Don‚Äôt go past 7.

**C.** Inhale and gradually ‚Äúroll‚Äù upward to standing position, vertebrae by vertebrae. Raise your arms outward and upward in a V, even stretching your fingers to the sky. Fill your lungs to capacity, and hold your breath for a few moments in this position.

**D.** Exhale, and slowly let your arms drop while extended. Let out as much air as you possibly can while you repeat this process for at least a few minutes.

**4.** You will perform two fitness activities today, one in the morning and one in the evening. Select the most difficult of your chosen activities now, when your willpower is strongest. You may want to run, go to the gym, do a yoga routine, or a bike ride.

To make this easy, I recommend [](), which is a phenomenal website filled with well designed bodyweight workouts. Pick a program that fits your current skill level and push through it. If none of this is possible, actively stretch or take a long walk.

**5.** After exercise, sit down for 10 minutes of meditation, preferably in a relaxing, quiet, outdoor space. Use a meditation guidance track on your headphones to help you get the best out of these ten minutes. Calm your mind as best as you can.

**6.** Open up a journal and write down a page of your thoughts. Complain, talk to yourself, and just get it all out. Then, follow a formula:

**A.** Gratitude. Write down three things you can be grateful for, and why. This could be as simple as your working two legs, a home over your head, and food to eat. Or, you might be grateful for a supportive family, a good job, and a great place to live.

**B.** Vision. Write about five years in the future. Where are you going to be, and what will that feel like? Shoot high and stay positive. Remember the classic question, ‚ÄúWill what is happening today really matter in five years?‚Äù If not, take a deep breath and write out a great story for yourself. [The 5-1-30 goal setting one-pager worksheet I made can help with this.]()

**C.** Others. There are people out there struggling just like you. That doesn‚Äôt make your challenges any less significant: it just means that you are never alone. Write down other people you know who need support and kindness. Give them your full attention and wish them well. (Bonus points for shooting them a text to say hello.)

**7.** When getting ready for the day, incorporate a cold shower. It doesn‚Äôt have to be for the entire time, but when you are ready to get out, turn the nozzle to cold and stand under it for 30-60 seconds.

This activity will jolt your system to provide a rush of energy and adrenaline. Many of those struggling with sluggishness and a foggy mind will appreciate this step.

**8.** Have the best possible breakfast you can. Make it filling, healthy, and simple to make. Bacon and eggs with juice, a low-sugar fruit smoothie with protein, or almond butter and english muffins can help you jump start the day.[ I've also created the simplest, easiest, and cheapest meal plan for high quality nutrition here.]()

## DAYTIME

Since most of us work, this time will probably be taken up by other pressing activities. Make sure to maintain a calm, healthy demeanor during this period.

Here are a few activities that you can use to stay balanced:

**A.** Take two minutes to breathe deeply multiple times a day

**B.** Listen to nature sounds on your headphones while working

**C.** Follow a to-do list without getting distracted by less urgent things

**D.** Stretch and walk around the block multiple times a day

**E.** Drink only water, tea, and coffee

**F.** Have a healthy lunch, avoiding bread and sugar

If this is a weekend or you are not working, you must still get out of the house. Go to a coffee shop or a library to read a book, or check off simple errands like dropping off laundry and mowing the lawn. You will feel much better in the evening if you have accomplished something.

## EVENING

Time to close out our mental and physical emergency health tool kit with a few evening activities. Stay strong, this is the home stretch which will cap off your reset and give you the boost you need to keep moving forward!

**1.** As soon as possible, complete your second fitness activity. Again, you could run, hit the gym, or take a long bike ride. Make sure you open your lungs and work hard. You‚Äôre going to sleep well tonight.

You are completing two fitness activities for a few of reasons. First, you want to make sure you are getting the essential endorphin boost that can literally transform your negative emotions on a dime. Doubling up on exercise is the best way to do this, fast.

Second, it‚Äôs important that you know, even in your worst of days, you can do much more than you ever thought possible. You don‚Äôt have to work out twice a day all the time: but now you know you can.

**2.** Cook yourself a healthy, filling dinner. You may be tempted to go for junk food or a pizza to make yourself feel better at the end of the day, but it will have the opposite effect.

**3.** Put away your items and prepare for the next day. This is an essential step, and will make tomorrow much easier. Pick out your outfit, pack a lunch, and write out a detailed to-do list. Make sure your home is organized and ready. 

**4.** Finally, take 10 more minutes of meditation before bed. Deep breathing here will allow you to fall asleep faster, and remove the lingering anxiety that has come on though the day.

## MOVING FORWARD

I also wrote a 160 page book that might help I never published called [Kaizen Habits you can just download here.]() It's filled with 27 mind, body, and life habits just like the ones above that are meant to give us what I call a ""stainless steel mind and a body machine.""

I'm also trying to launch a subreddit at r/conquertoday where we can support each other, share good information, and I can publish more of my research. Please join me and give me advice on how I can help reach and serve more people?

Depending on how burnt out you feel, you might want to repeat this toolkit a few days in a row! If you stay positive and trust this process, you should feel significantly better than you did yesterday. 

Just keep moving, and learn to enjoy the constant struggle that is life. I'm here for you, this forum is here for you, and we're all in this together.

I feel gulit because I haven't seen my baby sister in 6 years. I feel like I could've of been a better influence in her life. I feel anger because  something could've been done more to prevent this. There are not enough mental health services in the county she lives in. This country desperately needs to do better about the mental health crisis.
So I am extremely motivated to do something. I hate being inactive in a time of a crisis. I want to bring awareness of this epidemic in this small rural county.

It started with really panicked phone calls about people following her home and stalking her through the windows.. then the accusations that people around her were talking shit.. she would accuse waiters of saying they would spit in her food.. that people around her were saying mean things to her... she would have full-on conversations with people in her head.. she even developed romantic feelings for one of these personalities..

She‚Äôs been hospitalized twice and is currently on medication and seeing a psychiatrist that she lies to about her symptoms because she doesn‚Äôt trust them.. she wants to stop her medication and it takes hours to convince to her it‚Äôs for the best..

Whenever we talk, she has a thousand-yard stare and needs a long time to respond. She went from a bubbly, funny, and lively young girl into a vegetable and it fucking sucks.

525,"Why is it that family members are usually the ones that dismiss/ doubt the fact that you could possibly be suffering from a mental illness? Hi guys
I noticed that most of the time, it's the hardest to talk about mental health with family members. This might not apply to everyone but it is for majority of the people I know(&me).
I've been starting to realize that I might have undiagnosed pure ocd and anxiety due to recent events but I know that my family would just say that ""it's all in my head"" or "" you'll be strong enough to get through it"" kind of replies. That's why I've been holding back talking to them about my symptoms. I mean I did realize there was something very wrong with my mind since I was 13-14 but I just tried to brush it off. But it seems as though it's getting harder to ""suppress"" as time goes by and I don't know what I should do. Therapy is really expensive and I don't want to add on to the burden of my parents but I don't know what other way I can get better. My anxiety is getting the better of me and I don't know how long more I can ""suppress "" it.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I thank you all for reading this post.",1
526,"First time taking antidepressants made my life feel like it improved by a 100%. I've been off them for half a week and I feel like I'm in agony Exactly as the title says.

Several months ago I was given antidepressants for the first time in my life, and after almost 11 yeard I finally felt truly happy again. I felt like myself. For some months I felt like I could turn my life and MYSELF around for the better!

But on Friday I drank my last pill. Both my psychiatrist and my family doctor don't work for the weekend and despite two emails I've still no reply and no medication. I've had several breakdowns, I'm constantly angry and irritable and I feel like I'm literally falling apart..

EDIT: I must add that this entire post was a personal rant and I feel the need to clarify a few things:
1. Yes, I am currently a train wreck of a person. I'm upset, depressed, irritated, and angry, BUT that is mostly because I myself have not been careful with my medication. I'm experiencing withdrawal because I very suddenly stopped taking my meds which I shouldn't have done under any circumstance (as it says on the packaging).
2. Many people are finding this as a sign of how ""scary"" being on medication could be. I wish to say that mistakes can happen by taking ANY medication in a way you're not really supposed to. I have to REALLY try and emphasize that this medication (Elicea/Escilatopram, 10 mg for those who are curious) worked wonders for me and I have never felt as good as I have been in these last few months while I have been taking them.

Medicine is meant to help you and if one thing doesn't work try the next. You all deserve happiness. I am sorry to those that may have been scared off by my post.

I have been medicated (still am) for anxiety and depression for about 12 years, probably always will be. Recently, I was growing suspicious that my meds were no longer working for me, and maybe I need to switch. Too many crying spells, too much obsessing, etc. 

ASIDE from that (and I assumed, unrelated), I discovered my iron levels were low again. I stopped taking iron earlier this year thinking my diet was enough. I *never* made that connection.

I've been on iron again for only a couple of weeks, and I'm truly amazed at how much more LEVEL I feel. My mood swings are pretty much non existent, and I'm not curled up in bed wanting to die. 

I'm NOT telling you to get off your meds, but if you feel like something is off or you can't figure out why your meds aren't ""working,"" please investigate your physical health. They really, really are connected.

Much love to you!!

TL;DR I never before connected my iron deficiency to my anxiety/depression symptoms, until just recently. Supplementing iron has helped immensely.

I've never endured serious hardships yet, (Well I was bullied but that part isn't fully responsible for my depression, some of it can be but not full, that I can say).

I should be abused, I need to be traumatized by my bullies, I need to feel real pain just so I can justify my depression. Yet here I am, lived a healthy life, but mentally and emotionally I didn't turnout so well for some reason. And to me that is not a good reason for my current state... I just want something to seriously hurt me, be it physical or emotionally, then I can be ""Happy"" with my depression. This just sounds so bad as well, and I hate myself for thinking that way.",1

560,"Please reconsider your thoughts on Mental Health Awareness week and thinks of the like. Every October people here post bitching about Mental Health Awareness week just because there's a portion of people in the(ir) mainstream media who don't fully get the message and move on after this ends. 

But this might be the first year a kid hears about mental health because it's talked about in school this week. Someone might read an article or have a chat with someone and realize maybe they haven't had acid reflux issues for the past decade, they have anxiety problems, and go get help, like it happened to me. There will be a *reminder* given that people with depression don't always look sad, suicidal people don't typically warn anyone and people with OCD aren't just worried about things being in order. There will be discussions in workplaces and someone might find a coworker that shares their experience that they didn't know of. You will probably not see any of this with your own eyes because well, you aren't omnipresent.

Of course in an ideal world this wouldn't be necessary and we would all care and love each other 24/7 365 days of the year but this is the **real** world. There is heart disease, suicide, obesity, Alzheimer's, ALS, autism, places without clean water, anti-vaxxers vs. people who don't have access to vaccines and die of malaria; racism, human trafficking, drug abuse, places without schools, concentration camps, refugee camps, you get the idea right? This is a way of bringing light and education one cause at a time to people and places that might not relate because it's not part of their everyday lives, and teach them something. It doesn't mean nor imply they are not important every day. There's associations fighting for these causes everyday and they get the stage to talk about it when it's their turn, to educate and gather resources. It's not the solution but it's something, it's another step. Mother's Day isn't every day because we treat our mom like shit the rest of the year, its just A day in which we FOCUS on celebrating her, in particular, above other things. We are free every day, do you complain that people only celebrate freedom on 4th of July?? Should I put a clothes pin of EVERYTHING that is wrong with the world on me at all times or otherwise I don't care?

Meanwhile you're here bitching that maybe Barbie and Ken just put The Hotline on their feed and moved on. So what? That doesn't mean that's all the effect this week had. And by the way, what are YOU doing? Are you giving support to abuse victims at a shelter? Are you volunteering for NAMI? How many homeless people do you encounter everyday and don't even give them the time of day? Do you donate to or help at food shelters? Do you go visit children with cancer at the hospital? Do you advocate every single f day against elderly abuse? Putting a little ribbon on top of your profile picture isn't much help but coming here to bitch isn't much help either, and it also brings everyone's mood down.

If where you are at nobody gives two craps about yours or anyone's mental health, do like a tree and leave as soon as you can because it doesn't mean no one will ever care or that there aren't people that will understand what you go through. But try not to come here spreading negativity and telling everyone they will never be understood and that nobody really cares. You are doing each other a disservice. 

These changes take long, as in, decades. Generations of old people saying ""suck it up"" getting old and dying and letting younger more empathetic people take their place. And even then I doubt it will ever be perfect. So I suggest you focus on you and your well-being and surround yourself with people who support you rather than worry and get mad about the people who just jump in on the bandwagon. It doesn't mean it doesn't work.",1
561,"Do you ever just go back and forth arguing with people on social media until you realize ‚Äòwait a minute this is wasting my time‚Äô and block them for your own mental health? A lot of people seem to think that blocking is a cowards move but what if you just don‚Äôt want to talk to them anymore and don‚Äôt want any more notifications from them? This is why I hate Instagram though cause if I block someone I still get notifications from the post they and I were arguing on.

I feel like you can almost get burnout from arguing with people over the internet and eventually you just want to stop because you know they won‚Äôt see their side so it‚Äôs just easier to block them so you end the conversation. It shouldn‚Äôt be seen as a bad thing that ‚Äòreduces freedom of speech‚Äô but rather as self care when someone doesn‚Äôt want to continue talking to someone.

And yes I get the irony posting this on Reddit. I feel like I should just switch to posting neutral or positive things people won‚Äôt possibly have a problem with. Like I posted in a thread asking what people thought of a VAT tax and ended up getting into an argument with like 5 people. Eventually it became too much and I realized I needed to block them just to get myself to stop responding to them you know? It was something that was hard for me to do at first because I hate being proved wrong and blocking and not responding is almost as good as saying you‚Äôre wrong. But eventually I realized that it wasn‚Äôt worth it to continue to argue with these people because it won‚Äôt accomplish anything.

Anyone else have a similar experience with blocking people for your own mental health?",1

565,"Psych ward ruined my life and now i'm out of moves I was admitted to a psych ward when I was 17 for self harm. I don‚Äôt need to justify why it was traumatizing and wrong. As far as i‚Äôm concerned it was an act of violence, a kidnapping. I will never forget how powerless I was. I will never forget the degrading way they treated me. I will never forget the feeling of knowing they had their way over me. I will never forget the life I could have had that is now gone. I will never forget the person who died on that day. I would have to write too much to give the full story so I will just say it was after a fight with dad and my sister called the hospital baiting me by following me into the house and falsely accusing me of hurting her. She did it because she believed I would commit suicide in the future due to past self harm. Both my parents regret that day almost as much as I do. Funny how I have to bring that up so no one can pull the ‚Äúyou were mentally ill and did not know what was good for you‚Äù get out of jail free card.

I now spend most of my days in low grade misery, before my kidnapping (I won‚Äôt dignify it as treatment or hospitalization) I had no plans for suicide and I was optimistic for the future. Yeah I had problems but I just skipped a grade and I was happy hanging out with my friends. When I drive past the ER I was in or hear someone else‚Äôs story of forced ‚Äútreatment‚Äù I feel an overwhelming surge of negative emotion. I have severe hairloss as a result of what happened, I also lost my oldest friend because this incident happened the day before I was going to see her. My life completely fell apart, I knew my dream career was gone too. Now my efforts to skip are grade are wasted. The light at the end of the tunnel I saw turned out to be a mirage.

I live in fear of a medical emergency because I avoid doctors like the plague. They treated me like shit, they have my medical records and I never want to see them again. Hairloss has made me agoraphobic too. This all happened after a really hard year. And psych ward trauma + hairloss was the one two knockout punch for me.

All of this turned into (unconsciously of course): ""I don't matter and nobody listens to me, so if I get sick they'll pay attention to me"".

Many things happened throughout my life that ""helped"" the development of these illnesses but this mental process is fundamental to understand why I'm never okay. It took Depression, Borderline Personality Disorder, an Anxiety Disorder and an eating disorder alike Anorexia Nervosa for me to finally realize this (currently recovering from the eating disorder and it's one of the hardest things ever).

When I was drinking coffee and didn't understand the connection to my mental wellbeing, I would be sobbing for about half an hour every night. It would usually be something small that set me off that wasn't a problem until right that second.

570,"Living with chronic mental illness is so hard. Especially when your family doesn‚Äôt understand it. (Also long rant) (24f) I‚Äôve dealt with major depressive disorder, and anxiety panic disorder, OCD, and possible other issues. I‚Äôm the youngest of a very large family, and I‚Äôm the only one who has mental health issues, or who is open about it. 

This year has been so hard on me with my mental as well as physical health. It‚Äôs made it so hard the getting and keeping jobs are hard. Already this year I‚Äôve had 4 jobs, and been out of work for 4 months. I am behind on every bill, and my family just won‚Äôt help me out. I think it‚Äôs because none of them know this struggle? And don‚Äôt know how hard it is for me to function in this society. 

My family doesn‚Äôt understand why I self harm, or why it‚Äôs hard for me to wake up in the morning, why I have suicidal ideation, or have even attempted it. I‚Äôve been to the ER twice this year due to mental health issues, and the mental health hospital for a week. 

I just feel they all think that if I hadn‚Äôt left the religion they‚Äôre in, I wouldn‚Äôt have these issues. Though my hardest time in life was when I was going to church. They think I can just ‚Äúpray‚Äù it away. They‚Äôre always telling me they‚Äôre gonna pray for me, but that causes me to get more anxious. 

I‚Äôm also worried for the millions of nieces and nephews I have. All of them are in the church, and if they have mental health issues I want them to be able to get help. Or feel they can reach out to me. But none of them know my issues. My siblings don‚Äôt tell them anything about me. Cause I‚Äôve left the church, and I‚Äôm gay, and I‚Äôm ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù. 

One of my brothers keeps telling me to move back to the state where I‚Äôm from, and move in with my parents, until I am ‚Äúcured‚Äù. But there‚Äôs not a cure for chemical imbalances, there‚Äôs meds I can take to help, which I do. I‚Äôm on a couple antidepressants, anxiety meds, two different sleep meds. And they think that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs going to help me, prayer will. I can‚Äôt move back to that state, first of all financially, but for my mental health. Plus I‚Äôve found love out here, and if I had to move back my heart would shatter. 

I‚Äôm not opposed to religion. I think it‚Äôs great for some people, and I do believe that it does help some. But I never feel respected by my family. It‚Äôs hard being gay in a religion that says it‚Äôs a sin. In a religion who says it‚Äôs of the devil. A religion that won‚Äôt baptize a child if their parents are gay. 

I only have two people in my life who understand and who I feel truly care. My partner, and my best friend. I live 2,000 miles from my best friend. So that also makes it really hard. 

Does it make me a terrible person to wish that one of my siblings, or my parents had mental health issues? Just so they could understand me better? 

I‚Äôm literally about to lose my apartment, which means I would have to give my cats away too. I don‚Äôt have many people out here yet, and I‚Äôm sure I would be able to crash with my partner and their roommates for a while. But I feel like that would be inconveniencing them so much, since I don‚Äôt know when I could move out. Or with who? I got my car repossessed last week, so I already feel like a burden asking my partner to do all the driving. I know they don‚Äôt mind, and I know they love me, and only want the best for me. But my mind always makes me feel like a burden. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm expecting to come from this rant, I just needed to say it. And get it all out in the open, plus I‚Äôm a little high on Xanax, so I think that‚Äôs helping me write all this.

571,"Why people should have therapy to deal with past traumas before having kids So this is just a rant. Although I do think therapy is worthwhile, it's not always straightforward for everyone. However, I'm just so pissed off right now. My mum had a rough childhood. Her mum was very sick ever since she was young which led to my mum having a complicated relationship with illness to say the least. 

I've had chronic health problems for several years now and there's so much shit that I've directly been affected by due to my mother's lack of dealing with her problems. Not only do I not get any emotional support for being young and in extreme pain everyday, it's actually damaged my health as well. 

I've been ill for about 4 years now and only recently found out that I have hypothyroidism and am hypermobile, which contributes to my pain. If my mum had just dealt with her shit, I would've been diagnosed so much earlier and not had to deal with everything that happened. 

It wasn't until my amazing doctor was like ""hey we should test you for this, do you have any family history"". I said no as I didn't know but guess who fucking tells me that thyroid problems run in the family AFTER I get a positive result? I'm more mad about the hypothyroidism than the hypermobility as that is treatable and I suffered for 4 years needlessly.

&#x200B;

Now my problem is, I am 99.99% sure there's something ""wrong"" with how I'm wired. I just function very differently from everyone around me, and I've had difficulties ""living"" since I was very young (4-5yo). And lately it's just all come to a head, some symptoms are flaring up and I'm just drowning. After many debates, I decided to take an appointment with a psychiatrist.

&#x200B;

Thing is, honestly, I'm afraid that the doc will tell me that nothing is specifically wrong with me, and I just need to continue trying to be better. I feel like that would destroy me, because it just can't be, there has to be a name for what I am, and I so badly need to know it so I can finally understand why I am the way I am and finally have a ""frame"" for everything. I need to be able to ""frame"" my issues just to be able to stop diving into every ramification of every thought all the time. I need a diagnosis, and my fear before going in is that he'll just say ""you have no mental disorder/illness, its just how you are"". I feel like it would condemn me to just more of the same, without relief. 

&#x200B;

Are my expectations unrealistic? Am I just trying to ""blame"" all my issues on some disorder instead of just sucking it up and dealing like everyone does? Can I express these thoughts to the doc? Am I being ridiculous here?

Also, to answer a few questions: I'm not in the US, and my insurance doesn't cover mental healthcare (I'm sure they do for severe cases or hospitalization but I'm not sure). In any case I'm paying out of pocket. I have access to very good mental healthcare (I'm lucky to have friends in the field and the recommendations I got were priceless).

593,"Ask your psychologist or counselor what theoretical framework they work from. Current clinical counseling grad student here. I've seen a counselor and I've seen a psychologist as a client, and if it weren't for being a student myself, I don't think I would have realized how helpful it is to know the theoretical framework that my counselor used and my psychologist uses. 

The theoretical framework determines what guides their style of therapy and tells you a lot about what you'll learn to do by seeing them. Just ask them and they'll be able to tell you about it and their reasoning why. If you want, you can do some research yourself about their theoretical framework to understand yourself. This is so important for getting what you want out of the therapy that you're getting. 

For instance, my counselor used a mix of Feminist Theory and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. She was phenomenal at her job, but her style was too supportive and validating for me. I realized I was looking for someone that would push me and challenge me because I am lucky enough to have a lot of support in my life, and I've done a lot of self work to be able to validate myself and my trauma. So, I stopped seeing her and the psychologist I currently see works from a Psychodynamic perspective. He does a lot of challenging and confronting in order to help push me toward the change that I'm looking for in myself. This style works a lot better for me and I'm seeing a lot more benefits! 

So my point is, if you've had a negative experience in the past with therapy, it could have been that the theoretical framework they use was not a good fit for you. Asking them helps to determine this quickly and easily. It's also a great way to take charge of your own mental growth.",1

595,"I thought about killing myself today. Here are three reasons why I won't. Today I thought about killing myself. For the past few days, to be honest, I've thought about taking a razor and slitting my wrist or maybe walking to the bridge by my apartment and jumping off of it because it would be fast. I recently flunked out of my second degree and I'm ashamed of it. I had a lot of people in my life building me up to be successful and now I'm struggling with money, wanting to drink to numb my emotions, and hiding in my apartment because I'm too afraid that the people I love will get a hint of how far I've fallen off the horse. I have the means to commit suicide so that makes me high risk.

I'm not going to kill myself today.

Instead, I'm going to give you the reasons why I'm going to stay in this life.

Reason 1: 
I go to sleep next to a man who loves me every single night. He is my asshole boyfriend who doesn't do his dishes, pisses me off when he tells me my breath is bad, and he spends too much money on his car. We've been together for two years and every night he falls asleep holding me while I quietly wait for it to be safe to pull myself off of his sweaty body and roll over to my side of the bed. Our relationship is a beautiful mess. The first reason I am choosing to stay alive is that I am sleeping next to the man that I am going to marry. I think he knows it too. I am choosing to stay because I have the capacity to love when it isn't easy. I have the capacity to love myself today.

Reason 2:
One piece at a time, I can pick up the pieces of my life. I work a kitchen job on weekends. I get up, drive 20 minutes, chop some vegetables, wash some dishes, and go home with aching feet. But I also smile while I'm there. I don't feel like a cog in a machine. I feel like I'm part of a team. While I'm there, I'm doing things that make it possible for a group of people to do something that is greater than myself. I am capable of taking small steps forward because I know that small steps are part of a larger journey. The second reason I will live is because I have the capacity to build joy from small pieces of smiles.

Reason 3:
I have things to look forward to. I'm going to be a researcher and I'm going to be damn good at it. In my short time in this life so far, I have had the opportunity to experience the best feeling in the entire world: the feeling of discovery. After months of collecting data, reading papers, and running statistics, I have lived the thrill of learning something that nobody else in the entire world knew. Of all the tears I have cried, nothing has ever been more powerful than those tears of happiness that seeped out of me in that moment. With a joy like that burning a fire in my heart, I have the capacity to change the world. The third reason I will stay in this life is that this world will be better because I did.",1

Try drinking some milk 
Try not sitting down for too long
Talk about how much your leg hurts
Know that people love you and want your leg to heal
Get some fresh air 
Give thanks
 ridiculous right, the thing is although the intention was good of this post and I do appreciate that these things will help mental illnesses, it is sometimes as hard to get out of bed as it is to stand up on a broken leg.There is such a stigma around taking prescribed medication to treat mental health issues that even I didn't want to get them to help but honestly they have helped so much. It's okay to ask for help, taking medicine to treat a mental health issue is in way no different to taking pain relief for a broken leg. It does not make you weak and you are not giving up, getting help is one of the hardest things to do! Never blame yourself for having a disbalance of chemicals/ signals in your brain or having a bad day. Look after yourself, go and get medicine prescribed, go get therapy, do something that makes you happy even if you don't think its productive, it is as it is looking after yourself. Look after yourself people ‚ù§",1

-I moved house and my social worker disappeared.  

-I asked for help and was told ""I already know what you're thinking, don't say it because there will be consequences"". Then she left and disappeared.  

-I asked the community mental health team (CMHT) for help. They gave me numbers for helplines.  

-The helplines all advised I call CMHT.   

-I called CMHT again. They offered me a doctor appointment but said it would be pointless if I didn't want medication.   

-We called the crisis team who said CMHT would call me.  

-My social worker said she had made an appointment to see me but refused to give the date ""in case I'm busy and can't make it"".  

-We called the crisis team again who said CMHT would call me the next day, never recieved any calls.  

-CMHT had previously given me the number for a talking therapy service. After weeks of waiting, they told me they don't deal with voices or those types of problems. They said they would talk to CMHT.  

-I talked to a local charity who said hearing this made them angry. They called the crisis team for me.  

-The crisis team came to see me. They offered another doctor appointment and said somebody would call me about it. Nothing yet.  

-I don't know who to call or whether there's any point anymore.  

-Through all of this nobody has really sat down and asked me what's going on.

There's more to this list but I can't remember half of it, at this point it's a huge blur.

I asked for help because voices were getting worse and I was finding things difficult. Months later everything has blown up, got worse and worse and I don't know how to cope. I've done everything I can think of to help myself. I don't know how to ask for help or whether I even want to anymore. It's clear something big is going on behind closed doors.

604,"Finding a good psychiatrist is HARD I have been off meds for my severe anxiety and PTSD for about a year now due to insurance problems, and it‚Äôs been probably one of the worse years for my mental health.

I finally got insurance again and this process is so so HARD... there are so many options but how do you know which one is the best one? Which one won‚Äôt just push pills? 

I‚Äôve spent the last week franctically looking for a new psychiatrist but either they‚Äôre too far or their reviews online suck (should I even be paying attention to doctor‚Äôs online reviews?) or should I just go to the better rated ones and pay out of pocket (last resort).

How do you decide? I grow more and more desperate every day, my therapist urged me to go back on meds because our therapy alone won‚Äôt suffice to make me better...

I‚Äôm sitting at work at the verge of tears not knowing who to go to.... how do I make this decision?",1
605,"I feel traumatized by my stay in a psychiatric hospital I'm hoping this is the right place for this. In March of this year, I almost killed myself. I was honestly maybe 2 hours away from taking a bunch of pills and hoping for the best (worst?). I'm not sure why, but I went and got help before I actually did anything. Part of what my counselor suggested when I told him about my plan was checking myself in to a psych hospital for a few days. He said it could be a good chance for me to reset and get my meds reevaluated. I decided it was the best course of action for me at the time, so I asked him to start the process.

The process of even getting admitted was arduous. He made a call around 2 to get someone out to campus (I'm in college currently) to assess me and go from there. The guy doesn't get out to see me until 8 that night, and they decide to get me to the hospital in an ambulance so they can keep an eye on me. The ambulance didn't get there until 11, and I didn't get checked into the hospital until midnight.

Everything pretty much went down hill from there. I didn't get to talk to anyone who would tell me what was going on with my situation until the third day I was there, and at that point, it was the weekend so there was no hope of a discharge until the following Monday. So here I am, actually trapped in a psych hospital, and I have basically no idea when I'm getting out. I broke down crying my second day there because no one would tell me anything that was going on. They also withheld all the meds I was taking until a saw the doctor, which was 3 days after I got there. 

They treated all of us like children while we were there. We were herded to and from meals and we weren't allowed to do basically anything by ourselves. We couldn't even go outside unless we wanted to smoke. I went out a few times just to get some fresh air, but it's hard to do that when everyone around you is smoking. They also technically had a schedule that they never followed, so none of us had any idea what was in store for us ever. We spent so much time just watching TV in the common room because we weren't allowed to do anything else. 

On top of all this, they kept doing these group therapy sessions that were basically a bunch of mental health technicians talking at us. It was painfully clear that they had never experienced the issues we were dealing with, and they seemed to have a superiority complex because of it. One guy didn't even have a college degree. Yet here he was, thinking he knows all about mental illness and preaching at us to just get better. Because it's all in our minds, and nothing is really that bad that we can't overcome it with sheer willpower.

So I finally get out and go back to college. My friends had been amazing through this process, and they helped me more than anything in that hospital. That was the really frustrating part. I feel like I didn't need to be basically incarcerated to get better. I suspect part of the reason they kept me over the weekend was so they could get more money out of me. After insurance, I had to pay around $1000.

I still feel traumatized by this experience, even though it was more than 6 months ago. I can't sleep sometimes because I keep reliving it. That's why I'm writing this now.

My 2yo son will pass away, and I‚Äôm terrified
J has a life limiting disability and his health is taking a downward spiral.

I‚Äôve never questioned my own humanity more than now. I spend my spare time trying to fill my thoughts with work, motorbikes, Facebook and sex. I occasionally drift off into the shadows of my thoughts where the silhouette of my sons death hangs over me. I start by thinking of how beautiful he is and how wonderful life is when I‚Äôm with him, which then turns to vast pain in the realisation of what I will be losing when he will no longer be here. My thoughts often turn to how it happens, what death actually looks like for J. Which ever way I picture it, it is the darkest, scariest place I have ever known. I imagine that my perfect boy, my beautiful soulful soldier slowly suffers and wastes away, leaving us with memories of pain and suffering, this frightens me most, and the most sickening feeling is that there is nothing I can do to help him. Why is life so cruel? No, why is death so cruel? My thoughts are then lead to means of being able to ensure the end is quick and painless for him, and he‚Äôs goes out strong, happy and conscious... but I have no answers. More pain comes when I think of how J and I last connect... the last exchange of words we have, the last giggle, the last kiss, the last hug. How horrific is it that these beautiful things will end? More painful still is the thought of having my other two beautiful children come and say goodbye to their bossy, cheerful, gorgeous brother, and how will they ever get over it? I‚Äôm worried for them, sickeningly so. This leads me to my wife. She is the most astonishing Mother to my children. I am in awe of her everyday. She would do anything at all for her children, and I don‚Äôt say this flippantly. The adoration she has for them just amazes me. For her to lose a child would break her forever, another great fear of mine. She of all people deserves a happy and long life with her children as it indeed wouldn‚Äôt be wasted. I want to protect my family, I would stop at nothing to do so, but I am helpless, useless. We are all on a path to certain horror and our own worst nightmares will become reality. How do I prepare for this? People say to make memories. The children have school, we have a mortgage and I have to work... ironically, selfishly and wastefully, ‚Äòlife‚Äô must go on... the guilt is crushing. My beautiful boy deserves more of me, but then don‚Äôt my others? I am too weak to leave work for the fear of losing everything that isn‚Äôt important. But keeping normality also seems right and true, and also what our family deserve. I am a confused, lonely, sorrowful man, who puts on a brave face for all to see, but deep down is hurt and afraid.

I will always be positive, always will be hopeful, but the shadows are always lurking.

616,"9 Signs of Depression in Women to Never Ignore **Although still a taboo topic to a certain extent, depression is a serious problem in need of an immediate solution. Depression is a condition of feeling powerless and lonely and is more typical for women, rather than men.**

**As a sneaky condition, depression is very hard to diagnose, especially if the patient is unwilling to show any related symptoms. Aside from being stressed and feeling hopeless, there are many other indications which can diagnose depression in women.**

### 9 Early Signs of Depression in Women:

### 1-No Energy

**Depression takes away the will to be active and in good spirits. If you are feeling fatigued and overly exhausted for no good reason, you might be suffering a form of depression.**¬†

### 2-¬†Poor Sleep

**Insomnia and related sleep problems can be direct signs of depression in women. If you are waking up in the middle of the night,¬†struggling to fall back to sleep, depression might be the reason for it.**

### 3-Feeling Desperate

**Despair is a horrible sensation and a clear symptom of depression. Women fighting depression will often feel hopeless, finding no way out of a situation, and having no clue how to get out of this mess.**¬†

### 4-Mood Swings

**Depression is a difficult condition to diagnose, but it comes with plenty of escalating mood swings. In women, a sudden turn to anger or revolt may be a sign of depression and can deteriorate the beneficial relationships in one‚Äôs life.**

### 5-Eating Problems

**Depression suppresses the appetite in women, which can later lead to many nutritional issues and additional health problems.**

### 6-No Interest

**Women suffering from depression often lose interest in everything they do. From a simple chore to being intimate with your partner, a lack of a will can be an early sign of this disorder.**

### 7-Self-Harm

**Women fighting depression frequently experience death-related thoughts and have considered suicide at one point or another. Suicide is never a solution, and it can empower and worsen the stage of depression you are in.**

### 8-Feeling Superficial

**Depressed women will oftentimes feel as if they don‚Äôt belong anywhere, or as if their mind and souls are emptied of emotions and feelings. While this is not the case, depression tends to twist our thoughts and make us detached from the real world.**¬†

### 9-Loss of Focus

**Women who have serious troubles focusing on getting things done could be facing early depression symptoms. Distraction is typical for depression, especially in women, and it is not to be taken lightly.**

**Know that depression, and particularly in females, is very easy to spot and diagnose. For that, an honest conversation or getting professional help can contribute to overcoming the condition and going back to your happy, fulfilled life.**",1

623,"My wife‚Äôs just left me and I‚Äôm not OK I‚Äôm not writing this post for sympathy. I had a conversation with a friend today and she highlighted a problem and that Men don‚Äôt know how to express their feelings, so I thought it may help for me to gather them up here and try to make a point that talking or expressing yourself can be cathartic.

Basically on Friday night my wife left, saying that she didn‚Äôt love me the same anymore. There was no cheating on my behalf, and she was my world. I put her first in everything I did.

We‚Äôd been under a bit of stress for the past 9 months, getting burgled, moving house twice subsequently, both of us finding out that we can‚Äôt have kids, and me losing my job. 

I‚Äôd never been good with money and we lived pay check to pay check. I was out of work for a month, and with nothing saved, we were up shit street, but we came out the other side and we came up with plans to put away some savings and pay off debts (not massive debts, about 7k)

After months of little arguments and failure to communicate on both sides, she announced that she was leaving. I never thought it would ever get to that point but it did and she left.

I spent the weekend getting really stoned both alone and with friends, but all in an effort to not confront the impending doom.

Then today I decided to tell one of her good friends whom she‚Äôd lost contact with. She immediately dropped everything and told me to meet her for a coffee. I really didn‚Äôt want to move from the comfort of my 4 walls, but I dragged my ass up and out and met up with her. 

Whilst I told her a lengthier version of what I‚Äôve just described above, she told me that one of her husbands friends had just killed himself and none of them knew that there was anything wrong. She also said that her husbands never spoke about his emotions in the way that I did to her then.

This made me realise what a problem we have. We as men do not know how to deal with pain and suffering in a healthy way.

Now that I‚Äôm home, to be honest i don‚Äôt feel much better, but the time I was there, in the coffee shop, it made me feel like I was inside my own body again and that I could get through this.

I just hope that if someone reads this who may be going through something similar, it‚Äôs ok to talk. Especially if it‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs not in your close group of friends. Just someone who‚Äôll listen to you. I can‚Äôt promise it will help or make things easier, but it definitely provide you either a temporary shelter from the storm, or maybe just the realisation that things suck, and that they‚Äôre going to be like that for a while, but you will come out the other side.

Many people would clown him, make up of what was happening, or even play into it. We don't know what mental illness he had, (bipolar 1 is the most common thing people think) but whatever it was he lost the battle with it. He pushed away everyone, and many people gave up on him after his multiple suicide threats. But what we need to learn from him is how fame, being in the spotlight, can change and ultimately hurt people. You can get high off it and crave the attention  so much you do really stupid things. Things you can't reverse. 

When he had the police at his door, had an entire street in Brooklyn shut down, because fan were worried about him and he was yelling out his window and refused to let the cops know he was okay, that's when i knew something was very wrong. But you know what's worse? Afterwards, when he was taken to a mental hospital they let him go, the same day, and said he was ""agitated"".  This wasn't the only time he was in a mental hospital either. This speaks a lot about the mental health system.

It‚Äôs something completely uncontrollable and it makes me feel like such a weak person. Add to that the embarrassment of it all. Confrontation does the same thing to me, but only when it‚Äôs specifically aimed at me (more importantly my personal thoughts or actions, not petty stuff or conflict). 

I‚Äôll present some examples. The very first time I can recall was years and years ago in middle school (yeesh). I remember feeling extremely overwhelmed in a specific advanced english class, and I had finally mustered up the courage to speak to the counselor. I asked straightforwardly if it was possible to switch out. Was all good until he asked why. I guess I just didn‚Äôt know how to talk about my emotions, and so I tried my very best to explain that it was just too much for me and the teacher wasn‚Äôt exactly the best for me, but it hardly came out as my voice started cracking and tears started flowing. (btw he said I should ‚Äúgive it a shot.‚Äù Ended the year with an F in that class :‚Äô))

Mind you, I was a 13 year old girl going through it. Alright, fine, emotions were screwy. But, it didn‚Äôt stop. Skip to a few years later in high school, and (yes, I realize you‚Äôre still a hormonal, emotional mess at this point) a similar thing happened. I had missed a lot of school and was at a really low place mentally. A lot was going on in my home life and school was the interference.  I go to the nurse one day feeling sick, and the nurse asks me if everything about my physical being has been okay. We work up to the point that maybe I‚Äôm stressed out cause I‚Äôm not sleeping right, stomach problems, whatever. Then a more personal question comes up and I immediately start crying. Usually I try my best not to cry in any place that‚Äôs not home, but this is the type that I have absolutely zero control over and really feel so shit that I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm crying in public. 

Or Christmas Day last year. We were going around the room and everybody had to say what they were grateful for. Okay, no big deal, palms a little sweaty. This is happening with family that is not super close. Gets to me, I say something generic like family and ‚Äúyou guys‚Äù and safety. One annoying uncle probes for more. I delve into some more personal info. Ok, starting to lose it mentally but composure is still held. Then, he asks how I feel about what I just shared. I try to croak something out but I practically start sobbing and I dig my face into my mother‚Äôs arms. Very embarrassed, they try to console me, not very effective. 

This was already too much, and I could provide many more examples. Like crying during a mock interview (not even a real one). Embarrassed myself in a room full of mentally stable people also getting mock interviews and highly professional volunteers that were giving them.

639,"Does anyone else feel like they have no ""home?"" I don't mean being physically homeless or culturally isolated--but emotionally, as in having no one or nowhere you feel 100% comfortable or close with.

And for the few people I might've potentially felt that way with--I can't really get to know them more personally because of sociological and ethical reasons (i.e. a engineer and former Greek tutor--like I may not be their patient or current student, but it just isn't relationships you typically have).

What I mean is that while it's nice to temporarily mentor a aspiring professional for a few months, or nice to randomly run into a former student in town, you don't spend forever keeping in touch with them because that's simply not how life works. There's more important people to watch out for (i.e. immediate family, friends, relatives) and more important shit to do in life than just keeping in touch with people you don't really/never will know personally (i.e. me in this case in reference to my mentor/former tutor).

What can I do to remedy this? I ""click"" with very few people and most of my ""friendships"" are buried under layers of superficiality (laughing over stupid memes, other dumb shit) and transactional caring, if that makes any sense at all. I get tired of talking to people within less than 5 minutes, usually.

I feel extremely insignificant to everyone except my parents, and often crave touch/hugs, but literally freak out when more affectionate friends of mine try to hug me, even if they're the same gender.

Additionally, I have never felt too strongly about, or that I ""loved"" anyone, even in a platonic sense. I honestly do not know what love is lmao--is it that butterflies-in-stomach oxytocin-induced feeling you get when you see that special someone (romantically) or the feeling you get when you see a family member/friend and think ""wow, s/he is such a great person; I'm so glad I get to know him or her personally and get to be an intimate part of his/her life.""

If that's what love is, I've never felt it for anyone in my personal life either lol, not even my parents or closest friends.

I'm sorry if this seems harsh but it's honestly the truth.

I've noticed that many people around me seem to think the only mental illnesses worth going to therapy about are ""serious"" ones depression and  schizophrenia. Every time I mention wanting to see a therapist they think I'm depressed. Every time I mention being stressed, they think I am depressed.

I'm not depressed. I have anxiety. Diagnosed OCD and SAD, potential GAD and AVPD which I wanna talk about with a therapist. I don't hate myself or want to hurt myself--literally the opposite, any health issues make me sick with anxiety. I'm just anxious.

I've had them since childhood yet not even my family seems to think they're too important, or at least not major enough to see a therapist.

My mom very likely has undiagnosed SAD and suffers from panic attacks, which is likely why I have them, but is resistant to therapy.

648,"Happy World Mental Health Day! Exactly a year ago today, I coincidentally got diagnosed with GAD. It was the most terrifying day of my life. I knew I had anxiety, but it was never checked out or monitored by a professional. Before this, I had done everything I could to help myself because I was - for some reason - scared to take medication. I was prescribed a low dose of Lexapro. It took me 2 hours of me crying in my bed, terrified, staring at that bottle of pills to finally have the courage to just take the first one.

Taking care of my mental health, and getting it into check has been one of my biggest life accomplishments. This past year was spent regularly taking medication, focusing on myself and reading an array of self love/self help books. Aside from being a mother, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been proud of myself this much for anything.

12 months later exactly and I‚Äôm medication free (stopped in August) and my anxiety is at a minimum almost every day. It‚Äôs still mind blowing to me that I took that step, and that I got myself and my brain healthy. 

If you‚Äôre struggling, you‚Äôre not alone. When you feel like giving up, don‚Äôt. Getting to a point where you want to be mentally is so difficult, but trust me - if I can do it, you can too. Surround yourself with a good support system. And speak up. Your health is so important, and it starts with your brain. Don‚Äôt ever give up hope, as much as you want to. You‚Äôre important and you‚Äôre loved.

650,"I don‚Äôt know if I struggle with depression or laziness Hey all,

So I have a dilemma, honestly this is something I‚Äôve struggled with my entire life but it‚Äôs somewhat difficult to articulate so I‚Äôm gonna try to keep it simple and straightforward as best I can.

I‚Äôm either chronically lazy, or there‚Äôs something wrong with my meat computer. I‚Äôm not sure which one it is. There‚Äôs plenty of evidence to suggest that I‚Äôm not just 100% lazy though so that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm struggling with. I‚Äôm very disciplined and focused when it comes to things like my job, physical fitness and my hobbies (I spearfish and learn foreign languages for fun most of the time, I like video games too). I really put 100% effort into these things and have stayed consistent with them. However, for whatever reason, I procrastinate anything outside of that. For example, I‚Äôve been taking classes for my first semester of college for about 3 weeks now. At first I was doing fine, turning in my assignments and participating in class. Then all of a sudden, out of the blue, I just stopped. I started getting behind in my English class, and skipped my philosophy class. I didn‚Äôt even buy the books for my English class until today, and then skipped English because I was too ashamed that I didn‚Äôt finish the assignment we had due (we needed the books to do the assignment, and I didn‚Äôt have them till literally 5 minutes before class started). This is the same thing I did during my last failed attempt at school but to be fair I was going through an extraordinarily rough time as far as my mental health and family situation goes. But right now everything is fine, my life is stable for the most part. There isn‚Äôt any reason for why I did this. I can‚Äôt think of why. Instead of just buying my books and doing the really easy assignment, I never did. It‚Äôs like my brain just ignored that I needed to do that. 

I‚Äôm confused as to why I keep sabotaging myself, why I keep procrastinating, why I shlub off my school work when I know it will fuck me over later. I can stay disciplined with other things, but why can‚Äôt I stay disciplined about school?? I know you guys aren‚Äôt medical professionals and can‚Äôt diagnose me, but I‚Äôd like to hear some of your experiences with this and maybe some advice on what you do to cope with it? Cause if I don‚Äôt pull the reins in on this issue I will fail my classes again.


Tl;dr: I procrastinate my school work, but stay disciplined about other parts of my life. Why can‚Äôt I stay disciplined with school? What‚Äôs missing?",1

I'd though I'd overcome it by now or be dead. I still want to self harm, I still have horrible mood swings, I still feel suicidal. I'm still not mentally okay. Because of that I'm embarrassed of not being okay. I should've grown out of it by now.

653,"The ignorance to mental health is unreal. First time poster here. I (24F) was just in a very awkward and frustrating situation with my boss and just need to vent.

&#x200B;

I've had a pretty trying week. I've suffered with OCD, anxiety, and acute periods of depression for most of my life. However, my overall mental health has been in steep decline since May by me going through the transition of college to full time job. I got to work early this morning, sat down in my office, and just started crying. It's just been one of those weeks, ya know, and I'm overwhelmed.

&#x200B;

My boss (60s male) knocks on my door and barges in as I'm sitting in my chair crying, which then induces a conversation where I open up (a little) to let him know of my mental health struggles. And, guess what, he had some of the most ignorant responses and comments, which, sadly, I wasn't too shocked at coming from a more conservative baby boomer. As I tell him that I struggle with OCD, he actually tries to twist the conversation by saying ""yes, but you have to spin that into a positive thing in order to do well around here, you know, you can use OCD to your advantage at this job by being very organized."" He also goes on to tell me about his wife's ""obsessive"" actions, like checking a doorknob twice, which he followed by saying ""I think my wife's CRAZY because of it, but I just have to go along with it."" Are you actually kidding me? And then he concluded the conversation by saying that ""it's sad that you have to deal with these things all day."" Yeah, who would've thought? I don't know, man, I'm just flabbergasted at the complete lack of awareness over mental health basics. I just wanted to scream and shake my boss and make damn sure that he knew that these are real, actual, DEBILITATING mental diseases I deal with every damn day that make many of my days extremely hard to get through sometimes. They are NOT something I can use to ""my advantage,"" nor are they something that you can brush off as a ""crazy tick."" Anyone else deal with this in their workplace? I'd love to know.

i was scared i wouldnt be able to get off my ass and find a job. I was scared id fuck that up for myself too.

Well guess the fuck what? I got up and found a job. Ive kept the bad moods and bad thoughts away for now. Ive told myself i was proud of the way i did things twice this week. I was proud for making it through situations better than i thought i would, and im proud that so far, my first 3 days of summer are going good. My head tries to mess it up but so far we're okay.

If im being honest with myself its because ive found something else to be obsessed with and strive for. I want to lose weight (im not fat or obese, just a little bit of a pouch), i want to look and feel better about myself and just overall change my look, i want to prove something to the other kids in highschool/my old friends (that im not the unattractive loser people probably think i am), i want to make money, i want a new phone, i want braces to get my teeth in order (slight overbite) i want to look into becoming a carpenter when i graduate, and i want to buy all of my own school clothes again. I have so many goals that i want to accomplish and i always do this. I always give myself tasks so that my head never has enough time to fuck with me.

I wasnt allowed a phone call, no showers, not allowed to come out of my cell, and no change of clothing. I was told that ""I deserved this treatmented"" so I only saw one way out, by bashing my head into the cell door untill I passed out.

The second time I felt suicidal... I was under the same situation, this time I bashed my head for an hour, every other inmate was yelling for me to chill and calm down. I started having a seizure for 20 minutes, which gaurds laughed at. One gaurd decided to strap me into a ""suicide chair"" and put a gag on my mouth. One passionate gaurd finally noticed me tremoring violently in the ""suicide chair"" and took me to medical housing where I was placed in a ""suicide cell"" with a camera.

663,"I talked to a stranger and had an amazing time So I've been dying to brag about my weekend but no one in work asked me how it went so I thought I'd share it here. Just for some context I've been more down than usual, despite my best efforts. I'm in a strange city were I know very few people and have been struggling to find somewhere to live, so have been sofa surfing and sleeping in my car for the past three months. It's my last week in the city so I'd thought I'd splash out on an Airbnb.

So Saturday evening comes around and a woman a little younger than me knocks on the door and she's also staying in the house. She's decided to spontaneously visit the city for a night and traveled on her own,and she can talk until the cows come home. I make her a customary cup of tea and I stumble through some small talk. In a conversationly lul I bring up music and she mentions she's into Queen at the moment. I make a joke about how the Bohemian Rhapsody movie is doing its job, but she says she's never seen it and suggests we go watch it and grab some food. Which I I force myself to agree to.

As we're walking to the city centre she's talking and I'm mostly listening. 

 Everything she is saying is so personal and open. Talking about her relationships, how she has to pretent to be straight in her home country because her family disowned her for having a gf, embarrassing childhood stories, and stupid teenage mistakes. We end up going on a small detour in a little Christmas fair and it's packed and children are running amok. I'm really not comfortable and trying to put on a brave face, but she saw through that and, despite only having met me a few hours ago, noticed that I'd gotten a little more quite. She'd been so open about herself so far I'd thought I'd be honest with her and mention some of my mental health issues. She reacted like no one else has done before to it. Made sure I was okay, and made some truly sinsere compliments about the situation I was in. To absolutely no one's supprise a recently open gay who got disowned by her traditional chaltholic rural family also had some mental health issues.

We start bonding over anxiety attacks and getting more and more personal. We're two complete strangers how lived very diffrent lives in diffrent countries. It's clear that we're never going to see each other again, and can talk as freely as we want to. We very quicky dive into stories within hours that I'm still unable to even hint at with my therapist, and it ~~FELT~~ (still) feels SO DAMN GOOD!

We end up sacking off going to the movies and instead I offer take her to all the gay clubs I know. Which I almost regreted as she started introducing me to strangers as her straight stranger friend to other random strangers she managed to start talking to. I pictured myself drinking way to much in order to not freak panic in the crowds and to compensate for a lack of dancing/chatting. I'm delighted to report that was not the case. I had a great time. We both got drinks bought for us, and necked some strangers. Met some terrible people, and many more great people who were also just happy to talk about their shit to strangers. Again, I loved it.

666,"Talk about irony: Reddit is legitimately hurting my mental health with its misogyny Obviously, I'm not talking about everyone (or all men, or even most men.) I'm aware there are wonderful people, and wonderful men, on Reddit. I have interacted with them. So if this doesn't apply to you, and you're an awesome person on Reddit, then you have no reason to feel offended by what I'm saying. Just assume I'm not talking about you and move on. 

Nevertheless. If Reddit were its own country, there seems to be an *insanely* strong ""culture"" of misogyny here. 

I started noticing it in the obvious women hating subs: the incel ones, the MGTOW ones. That's to be expected. It's my own fault, for refusing to turn away from *that* car crash. 

But then I started seeing in subs that have nothing to do with despising women; supposedly harmless subs, like r/HumansBeingBros, r/dating_advice, r/AskReddit. So many comments slut shaming women, and so many worse things that I won't even get too far into (like excusing rape of innocent women, underage girls, and the like). Misogynist comments get upvoted; comments standing up for women get downvoted to hell. 

I'm wondering if this sub will be similar. I hope not, but I've been surprised again and again. 

I said to myself: if this is hurting you, for god's sake, log off Reddit and go outside! ""Real"" people don't act like this. But the fact is that these *are* real people. They're real people who feel free to say what they wouldn't say in real life because they're protected by anonymity. Then I  many men that I interact with on a daily basis feel this way? Are they among me? Perhaps Reddit (and all online forums) are the *true* reflection of human beings, because we can say whatever we'd like without facing social consequences. In fact, if the fake karma here is any indication, it's the people who hate women that get the most internet-social-brownie-points. 

They justify rape. They slut shame. They call us intellectually inferior. Millions of them. And then they call us ""feminazis"" and say misogyny no longer exists. ""What else do those idiots want?"" 

And it's not only men. It's women who internally hate themselves, the ""I'm not like the other girls"" girls, agreeing with men saying disgusting things, about all of us. 

What is it about Reddit that attracts people who hate women?....Or is it the fact that people do really hate women in these numbers, and they just don't say it out loud?...",1

Life with psychosis can be like this.  And we never talk about it. Which leads to living a life where we can't talk about the realities of our illnesses.  We learn to mask it with as much normalcy as we can pretend so that we aren't seen as a threat.

I'm 5'2"" and around 125 pounds.  Not exactly big and intimidating.  And yet I have seen, time and time again, that dawning fear in people's eyes when I talk about it honestly, when I say the words, ""I have hallucinations.""  They stop listening then.  They don't want to hear that my hallucinations are completely harmless.  There is no threat in hearing knocking or classical music.

No one would bat an eyelash at a person with any other kind of illness talking honestly and openly about living with it.  Not diabetes or leukemia or any of them.  But the second it's a mental illness.... 

I want to be honest because I simply believe in honesty.  But being honest can mean I am seen as a threat.  I am no more of a threat than the ridiculous stuffed animal my dog has been dragging around for days. Ok, maybe slightly more.  I do have a pretty decent mind.

I hate that being honest about my illness means that I am seen as a threat.  I hate that dawning fear in other's eyes.  I hate that so few are willing to see past their lack of knowledge and learn and see me.",1

669,"My grandpa hung himself Yesterday my grandpa hung himself.

I always thought it was getting better with him after my grandma died 2 years ago. Before this he lied all day on the sofa and did nothing but watching TV. After the death of my grandma he looked better, he made himself food, washed his own clothes (things I didn't do when I was depressive), do gardening work, did go shopping etc.

We found out, he was really desperate to get his old life back. He wanted another woman that did all for him. He did go to meetups for older singles, but the woman there want to go out and search a partner that want to go with them. So he didn't found one there. (The thing with the meetups was something we knew, but not how desperate he was and what kind of woman he searched)

Then he read an classified ad in the newspaper about a company that conveys you a new partner. This company (I really would like to write their name(s) here, but being the malicious guys they are, it's better not to) is pretty much a scam and my grandpa, which didn't use the internet once in his lifetime and being in such desperation fell for it. He contacted them and they drove to him (their hq, that might be a letterbox company, is 460 km away) and forced him to pay them 2000‚Ç¨ cash (they drove my grandpa to the next atm) for their ""services"".

This was ok, my grandpa thought, he would get a woman for this money, that will satisfy his needs. But, when they sent him another bill of 2500‚Ç¨, he pretty much realised that he was scammed. And being a man that understands himself as some kind of streetsmart, thrifty and unscammable, this destroyed his self-view completely and brought himself from depressive to suicidal. And yesterday he did it.

We found the bill and after doing my research many of their contracts are not quite legal (in the meaning that if you sign them you don't have to stick to them) and they lost several cases about this. Also what they did (forcing one to pay money) might be illegal (in Germany it's called N√∂tigung and you can to jail for up to 3 years because of it)

My parents spoke with their lawyer and he will write a letter to the company, that states, that my grandpa killed himself because of this and their bill will not be paid.

I do wish the very worst for them, even though I know, that depression is really strong in our family. My uncle is depressive and I was depressive, but recovered from it 90%. Sometimes I get flashbacks, so I don't really like to talk about it too much.) I feel so much hate for these people, because I roughly (ofc you can't compare your own exp to others) know how he felt and in which misery he was, and they thought, it would be a good idea to make some money.

This is scary. I don't want me to fall back and I don't want my dad to have depression one day too.

Thank you for reading.

Edit: Thank you all for your replys. It's heartwarming to see there are also kind people in the world. I've met with some good friends of mine yesterday and we talked a bit about it and I think this helped a lot. Today I am meeting a childhood friend of mine and I think I will talk with him a lot too.

I also decided to go offensive about this. Normally people in my culture don't talk (a lot) about suicide. I now want other people to be more aware about depression and also about scams. I guess warning/preventing other people is the best, what you can do out of this situation.",1
670,"my therapist really upset me I started seeing a therapist recently because I've been dealing with a lot of stress. I also recently went through a breakup that really messed me up. I felt like I need help dealing with all of it.

In my second appointment with my therapist she told me she thinks I'm incredibly anxious and she wanted to go through an anxiety questionnaire with me in my next appointment. So in my next appointment we went through a questionnaire that she claimed was about anxiety, but most of the questions were about how well I communicate with others, do I easily understand jokes and sarcasm, am I ever overwhelmed by certain smells/tastes/textures, and how much of a routine do I have and how much does it bother me if someone interrupts my routine. And many other things that were clearly about autism, not anxiety. I'm pretty sure I'm not autistic.

I honestly don't mind that she wanted to test me for autism, but it really upset me that she couldn't just tell me that she wanted to do that. I don't appreciate being lied to, especially by my therapist.

And I've seen her a few times now, and I really haven't felt like she's been trying to help me cope with everything going on in my life. It seems more like she wants to slap a diagnosis on me as soon as possible. Even her receptionist has talked to me about how they need to get me a diagnosis.

Is getting a diagnosis really that important? Am I being unreasonable for being upset about this? Is there some reason why she couldn't tell me she was testing me for autism?

I'm seriously thinking about trying to find a different therapist.",1
671,"Is there such a thing as ""irritability attacks""? I don't know the proper term for it. Basically, sometimes I get extremely irritable, restless, angry and sad at the same time. I feel some sort of tingling in my head and I'm compelled into physical movement, either pace around very quickly or claw at my arms or something of the sort, kind of like to channel the tension. During the worst episodes just hearing someone speak from another room can have me almost convulsing. It's usually out of nowhere, mostly happens during night time, and is accompanied by strong suicidal urges.

I tried smoking cigarettes (not a heavy smoker, 0 to 2 cigarettes a day) and found that nicotine provided a bit of relief, as well as cannabis from time to time, but they're not of much help anymore. I'm pretty sure it's not a withdrawal symptom because I've gone days without smoking and without having any ""attack"" (or any other symptoms, it was just me and vanilla depression), and they've happened shortly after smoking. I'll talk about it with my psychiatrist and I hope whatever she prescribes this time will actually help, but in the meantime I just wanna know if other people experience similar things, and if it's an aspect of depression or another disorder

672,I‚Äôm beginning to just not give a fuck anymore and it‚Äôs strange. My concept of fear has shifted so drastically as I‚Äôve gotten older that it‚Äôs bizarre to me. My fear of rejection has vanished. My fear from skating from the norm is gone. Even fear of physical pain and death just doesn‚Äôt occur to me anymore. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I live or die. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I ask someone I like out on a date or not. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I shave my head or get a dozen tattoos or piercings. Or start a fight with someone who crossed me. Fuck it. I just go for it because it doesn‚Äôt matter. And I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a normal consequence of getting older or if it‚Äôs depression or some inner conscience reflection of the world we live in now. I know I‚Äôd rather experience fear than this strange absence that makes me feel like I‚Äôm already dead to some degree. I dunno. I guess I‚Äôm wondering if other people feel this too.

I know you. You seem familiar, only in a way that offers both safety and fear, a promise of a better and more peaceful  there is one. The act of taking your own life in a desperate attempt to feel absolution. I beg you to leave often, you never oblige. I have no control. 

Dear Suicide:
What triggered you? Where did you come from? When did you visit me first? When will I feel better? When will you leave me alone?

Dear Suicide: 
You are relentless. I feel so alone. No one understands the silent suffering you have given me ‚Äî it is not a gift, it is a curse. I am disgusted with my life, a pain that only I will ever feel. Everyone would be better off without me. And I‚Äôd be better off dead. 

Dear Suicide: 
Stop stalking me. I have taken my medication today, you shouldn‚Äôt be here. Why won‚Äôt you leave me alone? Your voice is still too loud. I‚Äôm begging for quiet, not even the medicine silences you. You are a menacing force. I don‚Äôt want you. Please help me. 

Dear Suicide: 
I survived another day with you. Will you ever go away? I talked about you today in a hopeless attempt to have someone, anyone understand me or these feelings. I was labeled ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù I feel worse. Take my pain away, Suicide. No one understands me or you. 

Dear Suicide: 
You convinced me to hurt myself. One cut, just to try it. The pain feels better than anything. Euphoria. A blissful ending to a full day of warding off your demons. You didn‚Äôt get me yet, Suicide. I‚Äôve found a loophole to your awful game. 

Dear Suicide: 
One act of self-harm for each bad thought about myself, one for each time I wish I could have ended it, one for each person that doesn‚Äôt understand. A ritual of recklessness.  Weeks of covering up the scars I have made myself. You forced my hand, I had no choice. You are selfish and misleading. A daily reminder that I am still alive, what a good joke, Suicide. I would rather be dead. 

Dear Suicide: 
I don‚Äôt care if I die. Did the alcohol aide you in your fight for my life? It made your voice louder on this end. The pills never helped, you never shut up. I feel crazy. The therapy didn‚Äôt help either, I felt misunderstood. I felt limited in what I could and couldn‚Äôt talk about for fear of getting committed to a psych ward. You are impossible, Suicide. 

Dear Suicide: 
You might always be here. The medication might not help me, no matter how many I try. The panic attacks are a painful reminder that I feel everything that I wish to not feel at all. You are different for everyone and there was not a textbook warning sign. You remind me to keep to myself, don‚Äôt talk about it, suffer in silence. No one will understand you, you whisper. 

Dear Suicide: 
You are an entity that I wish for no one. A presence that truly never leaves. But I have other voices to listen to. 

Dear Suicide: 
I am worth it. My story is not over yet. There are more people like me out there. I am not alone in the fight against you. I may never be without you, but I will always find a reason to fight. I will be strong. I will persevere until it gets better. Suicide, the bliss and euphoria that you promise cannot ever compare to the chaos I want to feel. I am needed and I am loved.

You will never take me. ",1

679,"I am scared that the therapist will think there is nothing wrong with me and tell me I'm just being dramatic I've been referred to a therapist and will have my first appointment soon. I have always been very good at getting on with my life and covering how I feel... dealing with things on my own. I think it's a mix of being an only child and everyone telling me I was ""strong"" when my mum died in my childhood... so me thinking that's how you have to be. On the surface I do have a very happy and fulfilled life. Inside, there is always a heavy weight holding me down.

I don't have crippling depression that stops me doing anything... but that's because I think I do a lot to fill the hole that is inside me. I socialise a lot and have a lot of friends... because I hate being on my own. On the days I haven't planned anything, I just stay in bed all day and can barely do anything that I need to do like university work or working on my CV and sending out job applications. I find it hard to be productive on my own...

I am just scared the therapist or doctor will think that I am fine because I am so good at being ""fine"" that I even kid myself. I just really need help, I don't want to be so sad all the time inside and battle with my past.

681,"I feel like marijuana played a big role in my psychosis & eventually my schizophrenia. I'm going to start by saying that I have no problem with certain drugs, especially marijuana. Most of us have experimented with various drugs out of curiosity, or social pressure, or hell maybe it's prescribed. My background starts like this. I was adopted at birth in a closed adoption, I had bad behavior growing up and along with trying to fit in I started to experiment with marijuana bc it was the bees knees in the social group. I wasn't aware but I started to have psychosis and lingering away from reality (conspiracies, govt sucks, alien/ufo documentaries ect.) Like I said I wasn't aware at the time that something wasn't right. Then voices came where I could not control them. They usually were saying things like ""idk"" and I would repeat that after ending any part of a conversation with someone. After I saw a psychiatrist and diagnosed with schizophrenia and a month or two after the meds kicked in I was facing reality again and had so many realizations, questions and needed closure. I came to the conclusion that if I never started smoking weed to self medicate I probably wouldn't have had my schizophrenia be as aggressive or existent like it did. Just my opinion. I'm up for debate & counterpoints.",1
682,"Truman Show Delusion re-triggered by Black Mirror's Bandersnatch I do not have schizophrenia and, to my knowledge, no one in my family has a history of it. I don't know if it's even related. I'm also not averse to seeking a counselor but I wanted to put it out here first. 

When I was a kid, long before the Truman Show came out, I believed my life was on display for someone's viewing. I believed others potentially had the ability to read my mind, and I believed everyone I knew and loved was in on it. I played along and didn't tell anyone about it because I thought my loose lips might anger the powers at be and who knows what would happen to me. I should point out this wasn't enough to keep me from picking my nose or jizzing to a Sears catalogue, I was living a very normal life and it never impeded my day-to-day activities. I did try to say the wittiest lines so I'd at least look clever to whoever was watching, even if I was alone. This habit has stirred many a pot in my marriage, but there's a good chance it'd happen even without this delusion.

This was a constant in my life until my early 20's when I began to travel more and realize the magnitude of such a conspiracy. The Truman Show helped as I realized I wasn't the only one who could imagine such a scenario - but I also worried 'they' used it to throw me off their trail. It took awhile before I was able to let go of the notion and stop living like I was on TV.  Eventually coincidences were just that and I didn't think anyone was reading my mind. I knew it was ludicrous, impossible, nonsensical. 

It's been several years since I've struggled with these thoughts. A few nights ago I watched Bandersnatch. The relevant plot point is (mild spoiler) the protagonist realizes the viewer is controlling his actions. It's not completely related to what I went through but it was enough that these delusions have popped up again. I wonder if my wife is really going to work or she's with a bunch of lab coats watching monitors as I type this. Are they watching my kids too, or will they one day be let in on the secret? And is everything in my life being choreographed to reach some epic conclusion? 

I know it's dumb. I know it's impossible. Yet even as I type this there's a nagging thought I'm pushing through, urging me to not tell anyone about this because they will deceive me and the charade will continue. 

I'd really like to put an end to this. My biggest fear is this getting out of hand; I'll end up so far down a rabbit hole I'll become a recluse or worse. I could easily become a conspiracy nut, though I also have enough rationale to recognize when we're placing patterns on things that don't actually connect to one another. 

Anyways, I feel foolish posting this. I know it's stupid. Yet I can't drop it, and the fact that I haven't thought about it for years and now I can't get it out of my mind again is troublesome.",1
683,"From suicidal thoughts to feeling on top of the world and then back again I think there‚Äôs something wrong with me. For the last year or so I‚Äôve been having these weird episodes of either suicidal thoughts and depression or extreme happiness and a feeling of being almost invincible. 

It‚Äôs coming to a point where I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this anymore. I‚Äôve had a great period recently for almost two weeks and I woke up this morning with tons of energy but out of nowhere I just got this feeling of sadness and now I‚Äôm typing this and I feel like I‚Äôm about to cry. 

Sorry I don‚Äôt know to express all of this in english, I‚Äôm doing my best.

When I‚Äôm having a good period I have so much energy and ambition. I‚Äôm starting projects and taking on tasks left and right and I want to be super productive. I do crazy activities and I almost feel addicted to adrenaline. 

When I‚Äôm having a bad period I just wanna cry and not get out of bed. I‚Äôve had suicidal thoughts but not to the point where I‚Äôve actually tried to end my life. I‚Äôve told my girlfriend that I just want to stop existing, I just wanna fade away. 

I also feel bad about feeling all of these feelings. I have nothing to complain about. My personal life is good, I have a great relationship, a nice place to live and I‚Äôve just started college. Sure I don‚Äôt have that much money but I‚Äôm not in any kind of debt.

It just feels like any kind of setback is like the end of the world. When I‚Äôm feeling down everything just looks grey and I‚Äôm having a hard time staying awake even tho I sleep 8 hours a night.

I also start questioning if my feelings are even real at all. I‚Äôve tried to tell myself to just snap out of it when I feel sad. I know how to feel good so I should just be able to get back to that feeling. 

I can feel when the sadness is coming and I sometimes even tell myself ‚Äùhere we go again‚Äù. It feels so stupid, I almost wonder if I somehow create this bad feeling myself but it feels so real and when I‚Äôm in it I just can‚Äôt get out of it. 

I can go around like a depressed zombie for weeks and then all of a sudden I just start feeling happy again out of nowhere. When I‚Äôm happy it feels like the world is sparkling with colors and I love how that feels, I wish I could be in that state of mind all the time.

This post is getting long. My girlfriend has told me to seek help but I can‚Äôt help but feel that my sadness is fake and something I create in my head and I just need to man up and get out of it.

I struggled with depression for about two years before these episodes started happening. I‚Äôm in my early twenties if that helps.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm afraid the feelings sadness will only get worse.

Thanks for reading this far if you did and sorry if I expressed myself in a weird way

I just don‚Äôt feel like my life has any point. I wonder for how long people would be sad before they moved on if i killed myself.

684,"It got better, holy sh*t I apologize in advance if this isn't the type of thing posted on here.I just thought this may be a useful place to post this on.

To give you some back story, I was raised in a very abusive home and was sexually abused for a little over a year when I was 16. I was diagnosed with traits of BPD, bipolar 1, ptsd, and an anxiety disorder. I am 20 now. I've struggled intensely for my entire life, dropping out of school, quitting jobs due to mental breakdowns, but over the past couple of years I began trying CBT and DBT therapy and this is my life now.

So what‚Äôs been going on with me? Life has gotten easier to live. That‚Äôs quite the statement, isn‚Äôt it? I don‚Äôt entirely know what to do with this newfound ease. School, work, exercise, chores, and homework are a thing again. There isn‚Äôt a word to describe how magical this is. I‚Äôm setting and staying firm on boundaries and am in a relationship with the absolute love of my life. Things got better. Wow‚Ä¶ It feels so deeply unusual to say that. Sure, I‚Äôm still struggling, but it seems as though I‚Äôve exchanged or retired my debilitating worries for more beneficial worries.

Being away from family has been the most profitable factor in this whole healing thing, also getting a job holy shit, and group therapy. All of these components are really quite the recipe. There have been no mental breakdowns within the past three weeks. Like, holy shit! That‚Äôs huge! I can slowly notice myself comprehending information in healthier ways as opposed to the habitual toxic default. A weird byproduct of this is it‚Äôs gotten easier to sing. I can genuinely feel and hear the ring of passion in my voice.

I was looking through my old, angsty, journals and thought it would be valuable to document this feeling and state of mind, as a majority of my writing is just a display of my suffering. My god, it feels like I can breathe again. I can watch movies or listen to music again, and actually digest and remember what I‚Äôve just seen or heard. Life isn‚Äôt as faint and blurry and hazy as it was before. Colors seem distinct and lively. Noises sound unique again. And every breath doesn‚Äôt feel like it could be my last anymore.

And I‚Äôm in love! Super, proper, love. Loving fucking passionate, feverish, hilarious, disgusting, love. I‚Äôm with my best friend and he is truly the definition of what it means to be a genuine person. I could write 20 novels in a series about my appreciation and absolute adoration for this stupid, lovely, guy.

There‚Äôs much more detail and nuances that are happening in my world right now that I‚Äôd love to focus and expand upon later, but I had to give a brief summary and capture the glow and gratitude I‚Äôm feeling in this moment. It feels good to be back.

The reason I'm posting this, and disclaimer this will be very cheesy so get a napkin, I did not think my life would get better. I've had multiple suicide attempts, in and out of psychiatric wards, and I felt as though there was no such *thing* as getting better. When you live a certain way for so long it's natural to theorize that this may be it for you right? I was under this belief that I was treatment resistant, immune to getting better, but, and I can't believe I'm saying this, it does get better. With baby steps, albeit, and a horribly frustrating amount of patience, it does get better. Wherever you are right now, whatever situation you're in, know that our brains (and this is backed up by science yo) literally have the ability to rewire itself to cater to healthier thinking patterns. Neuroplasticity is one hell of a drug, let me tell you. **Healing is possible for you**. Also, CBT and DBT have changed the game completely for me so please if you have some free time I recommend these practices heavily. Love you all and hang in there. If anyone has any questions about CBT or DBT or anything really feel free to message me.

uscientific source: 

while running my partner recently got flagged down by a woman her age. the woman was quite shocked and could only ask for help repeatedly. long story short, her father had collapsed due to a heart-attack whilst trimming the hedges. he must have been there a while already and the daughter was not present when this happend, but at that point in time hasn't called the ambulance yet or done anything.

&#x200B;

my SO arrived at the scene the same time as another man and they immediately called the ambulance but let them know that the person is deceased for sure. opreator still asked them to perform CPR until they arrive. I guess because only a doctor is allowed to make that decision. 

&#x200B;

however, not to go into too much of a backstory, but my SO has had some serious health-related traumas and there's some triggers when dealing with the topic of death or loved ones dying. to top it off that man trimming the hedges was around the age as her father who's also gardening a lot, which couldn't have helped when she saw that scene. as hesitant as she was in touching the person and getting involved, she pulled through and together with the other stranger rotated applying CPR for around 15-20min till the ambulance arrived. the woman who called for help didn't even identify herself as the daughter until the ambulance was there, our guess is she wasn't that coherent because of the shock.

&#x200B;

there was nothing they could have done. but the point is that they couldn't have known for sure and \*by trying to help they will never be in the position to think ""is there something that I could have done?""\*. 

&#x200B;

I told my SO that I was super proud of her for helping and that she probably also helped the man's daughter somehow. to my surprise she sees it exactly the same way, not having guilt, not being tormented. I'm convinced that it would have been much harder for her to deal with it had she not gotten involved.

The driving instructor inquired my age. When I responded with ""30"", they assumed I was from another country. I laughed it off and said ""No,  just been a long time coming.""
I didn't want to get into the truth RIGHT before this person was going to be riding with me. That when I was 18, I nearly lost my life after being struck by a car. I was walking back to my college dorm with a friend and we were both struck by an intoxicated driver (friend's injuries were minor thankfully). I was a freshman in college and already dealing with GAD, OCD, and MDD. I spent my Thanksgiving break alone in the hospital. I was terrified. 
I went through 3 learner's permits over the years to get where I am. Each of them expiring before I was ready to take a road test. I learned the basics and then would get caught up in my anxiety and put lessons on the back burner. This final permit, as I was approaching 30, I REALLY wanted this one to stick. Years of therapy and self-work got me further and further than I had ever been before. Further distances, more complicated routes, even learning parallel (shout out to my awesome and patient husband as my teacher). I mustered the courage to schedule a road test this time. I wasn't going to let yet another permit expire. 
My anxiety was at its peak all morning until my  I passed. On the first try.

I've spent YEARS absolutely terrified of being behind the  possibly being responsible for injuring someone else. The immense pressure and responsibility that comes with driving was always too much to bear without flashing back to what I experienced. My experience has made me a very cautious driver and for that I'm grateful.

Now that I‚Äôm married my anxiety doesn‚Äôt just affect me but my spouse as well, and my insecurities and overthinking have already begun to cause issues. My marriage is super important to me, as is my mental health, so I‚Äôm feeling really optimistic and excited about starting this journey. 

Reaching out to a professional was a tough thing to do, because I didn‚Äôt want to think of myself as ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù But my husband had a great point - everyone has something about themselves they need to work on. And it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôre crazy. I‚Äôm so glad I took this step, and I‚Äôm eager to have my first session. ",1

Suicidal gestures somehow were toxic and we were all abusive clowns who did this for no reason.

my response: Yes IT IS TOXIC, but IT IS also a trait of Histrionic Personality Disorder, a real fucking mental illness, and Border fucking line personality DISORDER, a illness i HAVE! this morning i almost cut again because the content that was posted was too triggering, i already feel homicidal towards humanity and i despise deep down people, and seeing that made me feel 10x worse, i wanted to swallow a full packet of Valium and Zoloft, i wrote 3 aggressive facebook statuses, and i cried myself to sleep, and somehow me making suicidal gestures means my suffering was fake? none of you understand what it means to be a male with BPD and narcissistic psychopathic tendencies.

i wish many times if i would be dead, i want someone to reach out and show they love me and not attack me. I have long had fantasies of destroying the planet somehow through dumping garbage, destroying the environments, the fact no one understands my disorder and my mental intellectual disability is debitiltating and if things do not change soon i will eventually act on my thoughts and kill myself. most of you have bipolar, schizophrenia, depression or anxiety, but none of you know what it is like to be a severely oppressed rejected virgin male with BPD and NPD and a mental disability. The pain i feel can not be understood by anyone, this is why i plan to one day write a long manifesto, get the public eyes attention somehow and commit suicide on broadcast TV or etc as a message so you can all remember my name. i am having a eppisode now where i just wanna fucking break n cry myself to death but i won't, io want love.

my father tried to stab my mum to death and i saw this as a child, and i rung the cops while pissing over my feet, severely malnourished, i don't need more trauma, i can't take this, please show me you care.

show me my fucking BPD is valid. i'll read comments later, im gonna go obese binge on some fries now and watch netflix. probably  1 valium too to relax and my OCD is fucking lingering again.

714,"My Son Tried To Commit Suicide I guess I just need to vent so here goes.

My son tried to commit suicide yesterday. His mother found him in his room with a cord wrapped around his neck. He was choking himself. Thankfully he wasn't hanging from anywhere. 911 was called and they took him to the hospital. Thankfully, he is okay.

I am hurt and angry. I am afraid. 

He said he didn't want to live anymore because his girlfriend broke up with him. Or attempted to rather. He basically pulled the ""if you break up with me I will kill myself"" line. She ended up coming to the hospital to be by his side.

He is currently on a 72 hour hold and we hope he makes the most of his time there. He is on medication for his depression and anxiety. He needs to see a therapist, but how do you get an 18 year old to realize they need help and to get the most out of that help, they need to be willing to open up. Opening up means vulnerability. Opening up means trusting the person, and he has a lot of trust issues.

I have been a part of his life for the last 3 years. Before I came along their lives were chaotic and in upheaval all the time. Now with me, they have a calm, peaceful and more importantly, stable life to be a part of. This kid has tested me beyond what I have ever been tested. But I haven't gone anywhere. I have been in the picture, maintaining that stability. I love him like he is my own son. 

I am just at a loss as to what I should do. I am doing my best to be supportive, to be there. But I can't stand by and watch him break. How can I get him to realize his life is important, that he matters? That he needs to think about himself & not rely on a woman to make him happy? He has stated that he isn't happy without her. Why should she be guilted into staying? That isn't fair to her either.

She's 74 now. Over 50 years of fighting the demons within. But she's never given up and through all of it she is the kind, gentle woman I remember and love from my childhood. 

Did she have bad days, bad months, even bad years? HELL, yes! Literally hell. When the voices in your head are so strong that you ask people around you if ""this is real? Am I making sense?"" you know it's getting bad. When she tries to talk but she's in so much mental anguish she can barely push out the words and it sounds like someone is pushing on her lungs so hard she can't get a deep breath, it's bad. 

But then she breaks through on a better day and she's calling me to ask me how I'm doing. She's writing letters to family and friends to encourage them. She's pushing herself to be a helper in any way she can even in the confines of her senior's home. 

And she's never lost her faith. Sometimes the 'angels' she talks to aren't real, but there are days I have to wonder if her connection isn't stronger than I might ever know. 

She's amazing because I think most people would have given up years ago. But she won't. Because she's my mom. And she's a hero.

I honestly thought working harder was going to do it. I didn‚Äôt even try to make a connection between what I was doing (basically showing up strong then whiter away) and mental health.

I‚Äôve been crying everyday before bed and every morning and this is from someone who NEVER cries. But mental toughness can‚Äôt carry be forever. 

While this decision, to others, to my family and friends will look like another rash decision of quitting halfway through a good paying job, I know that I need to take myself out of this situation. Not to hide away in my bedroom getting high but to proactively seek help. My career, as it stands isn‚Äôt going anywhere. I can go freelance or I can even temp.

737,"I finally got some answers I was in a mental hospital for a little more than a week and I finally got some answers. I have some kind of dissociative disorder, also emotional and social issues. It's not much but it's a step forward. I got medication and I try to get my life straight. I started to study for college. I chose philosophy, my teacher says that it's a thought subject but I love it. Sunday I have an exam that hopefully will get in a seminar at the philosophy college from a town near me. 

After a long time I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.


EDIT: I took the exam and I'm in the seminar, I honestly don't know how I got it but at this point I don't care.

Also, some people asked me about my treatment and exact diagnosis and for a while I thought about messaging those people in private, but I decided to say it in this edit in case more people find this useful.

I have a not specified dissociative disorder, also severe social and emotional issues that come from my upbringing. Everything mainly presents by severe disassociation and depersonalization daily, I don't remember 3/4 from each day. Also trouble sleeping and doing weird shit in the night without remembering it the next day( banging my head on the wall, trying to open drawers and doors and not remembering how, moving from one room to another etc), slight visual, auditive and tactile hallucinations, forgetting things like how to walk, my name, how to write or speak or opening doors etc, a lot of times I can't feel my own body and I wonder if I even exist or not, if I'm dreaming or if I'm dead, so I hurt myself to remember that I'm real. Also I have a hard time socializing and understanding emotions, I mainly fake them and learn them after years of practice. For example, while I was in the hospital one girl burnt her hair with a lighter by accident, and for a few seconds I just stayed there watching her hair burning and coming close to her face before I remembered""Shit, you should scream. Scream you idiot!"". This scared the shit out of me, not because of what happened, she was fine in the end, but because at first I didn't have a reaction. Also I'm highly suicidal for about 10 years now and I tend to have outbursts and make impulse decisions often.

Right now they just gave me some antidepressants and nothing for my dissociative disorder. Probably they thought that my suicidal tendencies were more important. But next week I'll see my doctor again and I'll see what happens then. They told me that my issues could be fixed with a lot of therapy and I hope their right.

I asked him if I could help and he told me that the seam on the pinky finger of the gloves was slightly crooked - he was visibly having a hard time with that. So he tried on pair after pair after pair of gloves until one was just right (that being said, we did have our boxing day sale today and there were only like 12 pair left). He was completely embarrassed that he'd spent such a long time for such a trivial reason. He said that people thought he was crazy, and he looked defeated as he said it. I reassured him it was fine, and then I said to him, ""Don't you worry about anybody else, you just take your time and choose the pair that is right for you. If I'm not bothering you, you are welcome to stay as long as it takes - and if it goes all night, well then, we'll order a pizza!"" He was happy that I made a light joke, continued to try on gloves until he found a pair that worked and then went on his way. 

I realized in that moment that no matter how shitty my Boxing Day retail life can be, how shitty some people can treat you, and how stressful and hectic it can get, someone else may be struggling over a crooked seam which can feel life ending to them.

I hope that guy really likes his gloves and I hope he comes in to my store again. If nothing else than to feel some acceptance and to say Hello.

746,"34 male alone I no longer hang out with the few people who tolerate my time. My best friend has completely checked out in his own nihlistic world-view, fueled by an unchecked depression, that he refuses to seek help for. 

I have not been with a woman in 2 years, and stopped dating, feeling I have nothing to offer anyone. I also have come to the conclusion that I am still in love with the one woman I've ever actually genuinely loved, and wanted to marry. I've done everything I can to move on: date, fuck, drink, drugs, therapy, delete all social media, become a workaholic, travel, isolate myself, etc... I have no hope in rekindling, and I am accepting of this. I wish her nothing but the best, and she always has me in her corner.

My therapist is essentially an emotional punching bag. I had a lot of loss around the time of my ex leaving me. One: a close, long time friend and confidant. She died of an overdose while trying to rehabilitate. The other: my mother. A rare form of cancer took her at a rapid pace. I spent one of two weeks prior to her death in a mental health facility due to a suicide attempt. I checked out when my dad came to visit and said she got worse. I spent a week watching my mother turn into a husk while black death poured out of her mouth.

I've had a rollercoaster with meds. I think I've found a balance, but I'm still depressed. I can't bring myself to participate or do things I enjoy. 

I just want to leave everything and move to another country. I'm not delusional in thinking this is an answer or a potential out for me. The thought is relieving. 
I no longer drink. I occasionally have an edible to sleep. I don't ingest any other substances. I've recently purchased LSD. I don't want to take it recreationally. I want to learn or change my perspective. In my 20s I frequently ate psychedelic mushrooms. But the edification was only derived from horrible experiences towards the end of my use. 

I want to have a positive experience. I want to be a positive being. Enthusiastic about waking up. I want to find pleasure in my creative projects and pleasure in being with people again.

Sorry. I'm lost. I just needed to vent, I guess.",1

So over the past month with stuff going on with celebrities and mental health and such with people like Kanye and Pete Davidson it‚Äôs just brought up this annoyance in me that mental health for men is severely just pushed to the side and seen as not important and it‚Äôs bullshit. For some reason whenever someone has issues society and people in general have decided it‚Äôs more important to help a woman with mental health problems and to just leave the man out to fend for himself.  Why the hell its seen as ok to joke about it and be assholes to said people with issues but then give 1000% more attention to a woman with mental health problems attention and be a major hypocrite I will never understand.

750,"Does anyone else ever feel like they're not really in the current moment? It's kind of hard to explain. I moved away to college last year, and up until I believe May none of that year really felt real to me. It felt like I was moving through an incredibly lucid dream, like I was still mentally in my hometown, in high school, and that I wasn't supposed to be here but I was supposed to be back there. One night I was walking to a friend's house and I had the weirdest feeling like I was just completely back in my hometown, everything around me looked really similar, and then it felt like my life just clicked into place, like I caught up with myself for the first time in months, and suddenly I was in the town I was in, in college, rather than like mentally being in my hometown. The weird part is everytime I travel or move to a new place, the same thing happens. I went to Israel recently and the entire time it felt like a dream, and everything that was supposed to be new and exciting to me just felt sort of... uninteresting I guess. Like mentally I knew I should be fascinated, but it just felt like 'Ok cool just another place.' I went to Washington DC in high school and the same thing happened then. And I went again to DC a few months ago and it was the same thing. And the entire time, aside from just feeling uninterested in where I was, I didn't feel like I was completely there. Like I was still in my hometown or in my college town mentally. I think the two were like tied, I didn't find anything interesting because I just couldn't get into whereever I was due to not feeling like I wasn't there at all mentally. And even now, I'm in a different state visiting some family who lives there until school starts again, and it's the same problem. It's been two weeks and I just can't really mentally place myself here.

I don't know if any of that made sense but yeah. I don't know what to do or how to fix this, I don't even know what this is called. I've vaguely heard of depersonalization and that it's associated with childhood abuse, which I went through a shitload of. But I don't know entirely if it's that or what that really is. Maybe it's something else? ",1

Many nurses are very judgemental and say horrible things behind the scenes about the mentally ill. I speak up when I hear negative remarks and be an advocate for those fighting the stigma. My question to you is, would you feel comfortable being cared for by a mentally ill nurse? Truthfully. 

Also, just because I'm a nurse doesn't mean I am immune to having illnesses. No one said the brain had to be perfect for everyone, it's a organ too.

755,"I am finally getting therapy for my anxiety disorders My therapist lent me her Anxiety & Phobias Workbook. In it, it discusses minor and major symptoms of feeling anxious to full blown panic attacks. It also has TONS of coping strategies.

Its hard though. My anxiety had gone ignored since I was a toddler (I would pick my skin without noticing everywhere I went and it was put off as just a gross habit). I also have had Social Anxiety from about age 10. It was put off as me being shy. To this day I am deathly afraid of my future unless someone makes the decisions for me.

I am posting this to maybe be validated on being overwhelmed after learning to notice a variety of symptoms.

I don't know how to relax and when I try deep breathing and other calming techniques, they don't always work and when they don't work, I get slightly more anxious. I'm not lying when I say that I have several symptoms that NEVER go away.

Such as:

muscle tension, shaky and sweaty hands, shallow breaths, body feeling hot and sweating, and the painful tension headache that might go away for several hours only to return again. I was born with a mitral valve prolapse and arrhythmia and developed asthma at very young.

So If I am anxious all of the time with so many persistent symptoms, how do I relax enough to focus on getting better. I'm even on medications. Could I just be magnesium-deficient? Is this even anxiety or something worse?

Please respond if you have a similar experience. The fat book my therapist gave me says nothing about persistent/chronic/uncontrollable symptoms.",1
756,"I broke down crying over a joke So I'm a 16 year old male and I have been playing PlayStation with one of my friends for over a year now and we always play together, but just the other day we were playing some Michael Myers on modern warfare remastered and they kept saying that I had a ton of lunge and that I'm super laggy. I don't know what it was but I just got so irrationally angry and sad and upset with them and I just shut off my PlayStation and went and cried in my bed.. I don't know what triggered it but I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for about a year now and the meds don't work and they just make it worse so I haven't been taking those.

A bit of reason as to why I have depression and anxiety. My mother has a rare genetic disease called Huntingtons and over the past few years she has just been going more and more crazy, she was struggling with a meth addiction, she was mentally and physically abusive and about 3 years ago the state took me and my brother from her and gave us to my step dad.

(I dropped out because I was thinking about committing suicide and just couldn't handle the stress of school piled upon everything else and my friend is homeschooled so he can play whenever he wants as long as he does his homework)

759,"Find a partner who can understand Depression sucks. It‚Äôs hard to explain, to counteract, to justify, and it doesn‚Äôt just affect you. But when you‚Äôre in a serious relationship, it is SO crucial to find a way to work with your partner on understanding what they can do. 

My husband happens to suffer from anxiety, so understanding each other comes a bit more easily - but I really think the key to success in coping with your depression is to work with your partner. 

It‚Äôs frustrating to be on the outside... to not be able to ‚Äúdo‚Äù anything to help. It‚Äôs hard to explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù you need to someone when you don‚Äôt even know yourself. 

Work with a therapist. Talk it out together - when you‚Äôre in a spell and when you‚Äôre not. Let them know it‚Äôs not personal . It‚Äôs not their fault. Sometimes it‚Äôs the fault of nothing at all. But letting them know how they can be there for you when you are suffering is so invaluable.

760,"What to do when you can't afford therapy? This is just a throwaway account for privacy reasons and all, but yeah. I don't think I can afford therapy. Where I live, therapy is really expensive (where isn't it?) and the cheapest options on sliding scale prices are usually $140 - $150, and I definitely wouldn't be put there, as almost every therapist states on their website that price is a sliding scale based on income. Income is high enough, but I have a medical condition that is exceptionally expensive and am paying for college (online until I can afford to go to campus), so I don't really have the money to pay $190 - $200 dollars per 50 minute session for an indefinite number of sessions. I've looked at somewhere between 50 and 60 therapists in my area and have found 5 who accept my insurance - none of whom meet my needs. I don't know what to do, as long term insomnia due to nightmares and inexplicable and overwhelming feelings of panic at the most random of times are greatly impacting my ability to function normally and complete daily tasks.

762,"Anyone else struggle with feeling as though you ""never got to be young?"" One of the most difficult things about the fact that I'm in therapy/""remission"" now is coping with the realization of how much my depression and anxiety cost me when I was younger. It's ironic, like I could never see what I was missing until I got some perspective. I was severely isolated, toxic, and self-hating all throughout high school and college, and struggled with feelings that I was worthless and unlovable. As a result, I basically just drifted through that time aimlessly, coping with booze and weed and clinging to the few friendships that I actually managed to form. I tried to join clubs and events but always dropped out fairly soon because I convinced myself that no one else wanted me there and I would be doing everyone a favor by leaving. 

It's more than just experiences: I'm starting to realize that it's hurt my career prospects as well. My grades were decent but I never planned for the future, never did any of the external things that you're ""supposed to do"" in my field like get an internship or ""network"" (whatever the hell that means). No mentors; I could barely talk to my professors because of how convinced I was that they hated me. Now I've got a job but no chance at upward mobility and no angle to ""break in"" to my field. I'm no goner by any means (I hope), but even if I do manage to break in and build a portfolio, it's still cost me time, and I feel so insecure when I think about how much better prepared many of my competitors are, how they've never had to deal with this monkey on their back. 

Then there's the whole dating thing. I've never been in a relationship, and while I don't feel like it's ""too late"" for me there, I do feel as though everyone else is more experienced than me, has had time to learn to cope with the ups and downs of dating, knows what's acceptable behavior or not, stuff like that. I'm lonely as hell and get attached waaay too quickly and I'm scared to be myself because I feel like I'll get ""found out"" and rejected for being inexperienced, clingy, whatever. So I keep my shit to myself and hope that I can get far enough along to be in a relationship and have someone support me, but it just feels like I'm holding my breath and shouldn't ever stop. 

I don't know. It's hard, because I really do feel as though I've made a ton of progress; I've been in therapy for two years and worked through a lot of stuff around my family and my general insecurities, I'm working on a medication regimen that's right for me, I *do* have a job, and I've lost like 50 pounds since my worst point. And I try to have compassion for myself and know that I really am doing the best I can with the crummy brain chemistry I was given. But it's so hard to look in the mirror and feel like you're emotionally a decade behind how you look, and to know that you'll never get that time back.",1

Narcissists can destroy social relationships. It's destructive to us. Is it there fault? Yes. Can they help it? No. Do we try to help them with their NPD? No, instead we openly criticise and show disgust.

Sociopaths can be impulsive. Do we care that it isn't their fault? Do we care that they have no control over feeling empathy or not? We don't, we just outwardly fear them. I have ASPD so I particularly take offence to this one. I was criticised for not feeling anything after my ex died. It's not my fault. I didn't make a conscious decison to not be capable of empathy.

Then there's the paraphilias, namely paedophilia. There are a lot of paedophiles out there who have probably never actually touched a child. Thought about it, but not actually done it. They don't choose to have this desire, it's an intrusive thought similar to OCD and most are ashamed of themselves to the core and want to seek help to livinga normal life, only they can't because they'll be ostracized by us when they do seek help.

This strikes me as a red flag honestly, because they have 4 children and if they grow up to have serious mental problems he wouldn‚Äôt be any help at all. And the way my sister talked about this stroke me in a weird way - she also asked our sisters if they ‚Äúbelieved depression was real‚Äù as if it‚Äôs some weird conspiracy or theory. As if it‚Äôs something you just ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù rather than an actual mental illness people have studied for centuries. As if it‚Äôs *not an established fact that depression is very much real.*

Hearing this (and many other ignorant tweets regarding Demi Lovato‚Äôs overdose - claiming *addiction* is a choice) made me think about how little awareness mental health has at all.  A lot of people are incredibly ignorant on mental illnesses and mental health in general. It‚Äôs pretty sad that a lot of people don‚Äôt realize that mental illnesses are real and harmful - if someone actually had the choice to ‚Äújust be happy‚Äù then they wouldn‚Äôt have a mental illness to begin with. People with bipolar disorder literally never chose to have manic or depression phases. They *literally can not control those things.* It‚Äôs also stupid how these people will go on rants about how they think ‚Äúmental disorders are a choice‚Äù as if they‚Äôre actually educated on the subject. Back on Demi Lovato‚Äôs overdose, I‚Äôve seen *so* many people on Twitter say shit like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel sorry for addicts. They chose that lifestyle‚Äù or ‚Äúaddiction is a choice.‚Äù There are also lots of people that are *aware* of mental illnesses, but don‚Äôt understand them at all. For example, almost everyone is aware that OCD exists, but you‚Äôll rarely meet anyone that can actually tell you how the disorder manifests itself and how it affects its sufferers.

My brother recently went into army basic training. I've been missing him like you wouldn't believe. A few nights ago I sleep walked and then when I woke up , I was in fear and I was pretty sure I was in the living room(it was pitch black). I then started freaking out then blacked out and woke up standing in my room. I felt my desk chair then blacked out again. I woke up to my mom telling me that my rabbit had passed away (note: I've never sleep walked in my life). That day I said the only thing that could help me was a letter from my brother. We hadn't heard from him in a while so I really wanted to hear from him. Sure enough I went to get the mail that day and the only thing in the mail was a letter from him. The day after that I also received a letter from him nothing else in the mailbox. It made me very happy yet at night I was still suffering in a way.. I developed a huge fear of the dark ever since that night  I really can't leave my room at night. Then cut to last night. Last night I woke up sitting up in my bed screaming ""WHERE AM I?! MOM?!"" I didn't know where I was and it frightened me. 

I'm not sure if this was all one big coincidence or what. I suffer from 4 types of anxiety disorders and I stress about everything. Is what's going on at night because of that? I'm going nuts because this is all going in a timeline and it feels like it's not a coincidence. 

PS: I've never suffered from any type of night terror,sleep walking, anything like that.

We should do this even if we have no advice to give so that maybe someone who does have advice to give can see said post at the top and help them.

Remember, we shouldn‚Äôt worry about giving karma to someone for a post we don‚Äôt like. We should think about trying to help people get better in any way we can. Upvotimg can really help with that 

So just try to take a look at whatever new pinned post is there and offer some advice. And if you can‚Äôt, just give it an upvote so that maybe someone else can give some advice. And if you can, why not do both? Give advice and upvote! It‚Äôs one of the easiest ways to spread positivity and to help people out on this subreddit!

798,"Lost Girl Searching in the Dark 9 weeks ago tomorrow I lost my best friend.

We spent every day together and were talking that morning. She had depression. We both do. We have our individual reasons and have suffered a long time. But there were no sinister signs. Her smile could light up any room and we were as close as twin sisters. We even wore matching outfits to events. We were ""those people"".

At 9:30am on the day we were discussing our weekend plans and deciding what to have for dinner. Everything was fine. At 10:20am there was a 12 minute phone call between herself and her not-so-close husband. She was dead at 11:11am.

Her husband is not a bad guy, but their marriage had been turmoil for years. Little things you know. A lack of communication, no intimacy, neither had said ""I love you"" since their wedding (5years).

My husband, my best friend and I were always together. We were the three muskateers. My husband had called her at 11am and she didnt answer which was strange. Her husband 'had a feeling' and went home to see her at lunch (rarely does he go home for anything). Sadly they found her hanging. I was there in 3 minutes, before the ambulance or police arrived. I tried so hard to keep her but she was gone. My first aid training was useless in this instance.

In her letter she mostly writes of her love for her gorgeous little girl (my goddaughter), how she 'has to do this' for her self respect, how she loves me and is sorry to leave me alone and how happy she was with me & my husband.

I love her so much. So so so very much. Nearly as much as I love her daughter. I am happy in my marriage. I have a few life issues but who doesn't. I have never been suicidal. I have thought about alternatively lives but never truly thought of ending mine. Though she would probably tell you the same about herself. 

Since her passing, not a minute goes by without me thinking about her. This is normal. Also since her passing, not a day has gone by that I have not thought about my own death and how I can't wait to be with her. Again, I don't think I'm suicidal. I just want to be with my best friend. I just want to make sure she is happy now and at peace. I want to know that this was all for a purpose - her happiness. I want her to know how loved and cared for she is. I want to tell her myself. I don't know if these thoughts will ever end. I'm scared. 

At midnight tonight I will be spreading her ashes in the pacific ocean. Her favourite beach. I am on my way now. She would have been 28 years old tomorrow. Happy Birthday, my love.",1

As far as I'm concerned, making a Facebook status about your self diagnosed depression and anxiety isn't helping anyone. Encouraging people to reach out to those they're concerned about while simultaneously getting frustrated and bitching about the distant friend you've not heard from in months is not helping anyone. Putting the idea in people's heads that because they have the odd down day or they get nervous about certain situations, they must be suffering with a mental illness, is not helping anyone. I haven't felt this on edge and incapable of maturely dealing with difficult things in a long time and seeing people bleat about depression and anxiety in such a hollow, hypocritical, self serving manner has really taken its toll on me.

804,"After 7 years of living together, my fiancee [24/F], has been begging me [24/M] for an engagement ring for 3 years now. 4 months after I proposed and her saying yes, she left without giving any reason. She takes multiple medications for depression and bipolar disorder. I cannot stress how understanding I have been with what she calls the chemical imbalances in her brain. I am a very open and communicative person, and whenever she has had a problem in our relationship, I sit down and do my best to start a conversation where she can tell me anything and everything that is bothering her. The problem is, even though I approach her calmly, letting her know I love her, and talking about any problems can only strengthen our relationship, she never does, insisting everything is fine, and she is so happy and so in love with me.

Every now and then she forgets to take her meds, it is odd because I can notice almost immediately. When she doesn't take them, she seems so full of life, more talkative, sassy but in a fun and loving way, but, the other thing I notice is how quickly she can change on the spot, suddenly so mad about something quite irrational. It gets to the point where even common sense logic is lost to her, she just starts lashing out, I will say ""lets find a way to calmly talk about whatever it is you are mad about"". She will either respond with becoming more aggressive, or completely hole up and not speak to me for hours. I'm not perfectly educated on chemical imbalances in the brain, but I didn't think missing 1 day a week on her meds (which is usually sundays when she sleeps in) could affect her that much. To be perfectly honest, I have never been wrong when I question her about her skipping her meds for the day, I never gloat about being right, and she does admit she didn't take them.

I love the hell out of her, she has taken suicide attempts on her life before we were together. I have been cheering her on this whole time, trying to help her keep up with her hobbies of painting and drawing. Encouraging her to go work out with me because she has gained a fair amount of weight, which I never, ever, shamed her for and actually told her she is sexy to me no matter what, and that I love everything about her, even any tiny imperfection she may have just makes me love her more.

She has said terrible things and even given up on our relationship before without ever communicating there were any problems at all. Only to come back the next day profusely apologizing and admitting how crazy she was acting. She goes on to tell me how much I mean to her, that I am her world, etc. This has happened 3 times where she gives up, then realizes she absolutely loves me and wants to be by my side forever.

I forgive her for these things, even though it breaks my heart every time. I go on to say these bad moments can be easily navigated if she were to just come and communicate to me. She says she will work to communicate better to avoid these bad times and she will try harder because she wants to spend her life with me.

We seemed happy, I had proposed because she had been telling me she wanted to be married. I proposed because I loved her more than I love myself. After 4 months of being engaged, she left. She never even showed the smallest sign she was unhappy. In fact the day before she left, we were both having an amazing time playing with our dogs in the park. Laughing, running, even looking into each others eyes and expressing our love.

She moved to her parents, left me with all the bills, took one of our dogs, and when I asked why, she couldn't give me a reason. I would gladly fight for her, but now she has turned so incredibly mean and cold. I need help figuring out if i can help her, if this is because of her meds, (which I believe are 3 separate medications at fairly high doses, her parents put her on since she was 13), or if I am at fault in any way by not dealing with her problems correctly.

After 7 years of a relationship, she didn't shed a single tear, she acts like I did something terrible, wont talk to me, and I feel like I am in hell because she wont even give me a reason. She gets to be surrounded by loved ones at her parents, Im all alone in this house after 7 years of love. She was planning all the details of our wedding, appearing to be so excited, even the day before she left. Now she is posting constantly everyday all over social media how happy she is being single and making me out to be such a bad guy. When not even 4 months ago she was practically begging for a ring. And a week ago getting so excited about our wedding.

Is this some problem with the meds? We hardly ever fight, our friends have told us what a wonderful relationship we have, and I have helped her so much with her self image, depression, and other issues, which I am happy to do. Does she really not love me? Maybe the meds? She has never gone this far before. Her actions and words had me convinced she was happy. I'm so confused.

TL;DR - Fiancee says she loves me and never shows signs of being unhappy. She has a history of mental problems and left suddenly with no words. Is this a breakdown or was she keeping her unhappiness to herself. I am in no way blaming the meds, I just know this is just so out of character, and from past experiences she come back down to Earth, and she has also admitted to the meds messing with her ability to express almost anything.",1

808,"Kate Spade Suicide - Media Miseducates the Public about Bipolar Suicide Some people with Bipolar ""Depression"" will never understand their own illness.  The profession of psychiatry is partly to blame for the fact that most people are miseducated about serious 'mental'  illness.  The terminology ""depression"" and their characterization of ""mood disorder"" are roots of the problem.  The media does their job to spread misunderstanding, often referring to someone having ""battled demons"" or struggling with ""mental health issues"".



This article is written by an expert on the topic of Bipolar suicide:



This was a superbly written article, but even so, it is possible that many people will still not understand.  We are conditioned to think that suicide is caused by extreme sadness and despair brought about by difficult life circumstances.  It is extremely difficult to break out of that mode of thinking to try and process some other conceptual explanation.  Many people who begin experiencing symptoms of Bipolar ""depression"" will try to make sense of it by attributing the dysphoric feelings to some acute stressor in their life.  This is where widespread misunderstanding of the disorder is so very dangerous...because people just do not know what they are dealing with and won't seek treatment.  Also, because of the deep-seated problems and ideological infighting in the world of psychiatry, some diagnosed people still do not understand their own illness.  

One note about the article:  The writer may or may not realize that someone who temporarily lacks insight (anosognosia...a neurological condition) due to acute psychosis will not be able to carry out a plan to save themselves.  Even psychosis is not what most people think it is.  Psychosis is not psychological detachment from  is a neurological detachment.

Some advocates are calling for what are called psychotic disorders to be reclassified out of the mental health system because they are not psychological/emotional/behavioral disorders (although they certainly affect emotional expression and behavior).  Bipolar, Schizophrenia, and other brain disorders that can cause psychosis are really neurological disorders that involve abnormal neural/electro-chemical abnormality in the brain and should be treated and insurance reimbursed under the mainstream medical health system.  Reclassification would not only help the general public to make progress in understanding these neurological disorders, it would lead to better access and reimbursement to treatment.

827,"Do you think mental illness is romanticized? In my opinion, people, including me, romanticize their own mental illness to help themselves cope with it. I‚Äôm in a master‚Äôs level mental health degree program and my professor put an image up today that stated ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to let go of the demons inside you because they were holding you when nobody else did.‚Äù And he asked us all what we thought of it. 

I raised my hand and stated that I believed this was a romanticized view of mental illness. I think that we romanticize  as a way to cope with what‚Äôs going on. Because in reality, our mental illness, our ‚Äúdemon‚Äù is not helping us in any way. But sometimes we take on our mental health as our identity because it‚Äôs comforting to us and it‚Äôs what we know. It can be scary to break into a normal or healthy state of mind.

828,"Why The Physical Manifestations Of Anxiety Are So Overlooked? When diagnosing anxiety, it's all about getting to the bottom of the obstacles that plague your mind, the barriers that stop you from having confidence to function ""normally"" - i.e socialize, work, engage in education, etc. 

But anxiety, for a lot of us, goes beyond the thoughts. For most of us, it is also an abundance of sweating, gastric issues, tremors, insomnia, nausea. 

Treating anxiety is not about a cure. It never will be. You can't cure mental health. It's about coping. Sure, send me to therapy so I can cope with the thoughts, but the thoughts will always be there, ergo so will the physical symptoms of anxiety. How am I expected to ""cope"" with that when so much of it contributes to my anxiety. Excessive sweating? You can bet it's stopped me from engaging in a lot of activities. Gastric issues? I had to drop out of college where the gastric issues actually became such an embarrassment. Tremors? I can barely write a sentence without it looking like a spider has crawled across my paper. Insomnia? Well, let's just say I missed college A LOT because I was never well-rested. 

So why are doctors so dismissive of the physical manifestations of anxiety when, actually, they are the worst part of the illness? The cycle of - I have these symptoms because of anxiety, but these symptoms also make me anxious to be in public situations. 

Anxiety is a PHYSICAL issue too, it extends beyond the mind and should be treated as would, say, irritable bowel syndrome would be. ",1

835,"I (31f) saved my (14f) step-daughters life from suicide for the third time on Monday Let me start by saying, my step-daughter is okay and there is no lasting damage from the attempt. She is receiving acute care at the moment and her father and I are desperately trying to find a residential treatment center for her so she can receive the intensive treatment she needs. I am going to refer to my step daughter a C for the sake of privacy in this post.

&#x200B;

Background: I have been with my husband for 10 years and have been C's full time mom for 8 years. C's mother is a mess and has not had any access to her for the past five years due to drug use and abuse. Bio-Mom has a gaggle of mental health issues and doesn't have custody of any of her five children.

&#x200B;

C's mother still had visitation rights back in 2012 when C would have been seven years old, and C went to spend five weeks over summer vacation with mom. Day one C calls us distressed and ""homesick"" said she had thrown up but Mom took the phone and said everything was fine she was just nervous to be in a new place (Mom lived two states away). We received periodic phone calls from C over the five weeks and she never quite seemed her normal, goofy seven year old self but we thought that maybe she was upset about having to stay with her mother because she was missing out on summer fun with her friends at home. We pick her up at the end of the five weeks and the first few days home she was her excited, happy self but she was SUPER clingy, we chalked it up to the long separation. A few days after being home she started telling us about her time at her mothers house and it became very clear that C had spent most of her time at ""Uncle Jr's"" house being babysat by him and his wife, she spend every day but Sunday at this home including over nights. We were upset but we became more concerned when she told us that she was locked into what was called the ""kids room"" with two boys between the ages of 12-14. 

&#x200B;

From that summer on C's demeanor and behavior changed dramatically. She began destroying our home; peeling varnish off of our hard wood floors, carving holes into our walls, she removed outlet covers and played with electricity and encouraged her younger brother to stick his fingers in, she cut the cords on our blinds, broke off doorknobs. On top of all this she was lying constantly to us, neighbors, teachers, our priest at church. Making up stories that we didn't feed her, that we shaved her head (she said this with waist length hair on her head), that she had broken her leg and had to use a wheel chair when she was a toddler, and has told others that either myself or my husband had died. That escalated to skipping school, breaking into a neighbors house, and playing with fire in third grade. We have had her in various forms of therapy and treatment for these behaviors but they have only become worse with time.

&#x200B;

In middle school her school gave her a Chromebook and that is when the worst of the problems started. Once she had access to the internet she began engaging in sexual conversations  and roleplay games with strangers online, posting pictures of herself, her siblings, and our home as well as posting where she went to school. We have been on a crusade the keep her away from the internet including cancelling our in home internet but she started using friends devices and the school technology to continue this behavior. The first time we found out about her online activity was the first time she attempted to commit suicide. I was home alone with her and our three other children and when I found she had stolen the chromebook from school again she physically assaulted me and when she couldn't wrestle the computer from me she went into the bathroom locked the door and drank two bottles of acetone nail polish remover and a bathroom cleanser. I called 911 and she was rushed to the hospital. She was admitted for four days and was discharged stable but without a diagnosis. We didn't feel that we could keep her safe at home so we contacted a local organization that helps with troubled youth but they are not a treatment facility. She stayed there for eight months and seemed to make a lot of improvement, we had her on an antidepressant and she had been diagnosed with ADD during her stay by her regular psychologist. 

&#x200B;

She was home for two and half months before she made her second suicide attempt by cutting her wrists. Again I was the one who found her and called 911, she was placed on 72 hour hold, given no diagnosis, and released. At this point we contacted family and children services to get any extra support we could and we were told that the only option they offer at this point is to place her into state custody and institutionalize her. That is not something we want to do if it can be helped so we chose to instead double down on her behavioral therapy, counseling, and trauma therapy. Another two months passed before the risk taking behavior on the internet was discovered yet again which led to another physical attack from C, she went to school that day and didn't come home after. We called all her friends and discovered that she had ""run away"" to a friends house and convinced the friend's mother that we were abusing her and if she was sent home that she would be beaten. The friend's mother decided she didn't want to be involved and dropped C off at the local police station. The police questioned her and was going to bring her home but she threatened to commit suicide if they took her home so instead they took her to the hospital where she was stabilized and sent to a youth facility for four days. Released once again with no diagnosis. 

&#x200B;

This past November we discovered she had a 50 year old truck driver online boyfriend (we discovered our well meaning neighbors gave her their wifi password) and we once again shut down all access to the internet. She went to school, put dark make-up under her eye, hit herself with a hair brush to make welts and went to the school officials and reported that we had beaten her up the night before. The Child Protection Services officer noticed that she had a shimmer under her eye and asked her to wash her face, it was then revealed to CPS that C was faking the accusation. They placed her again in the local youth home while they conducted an investigation. It was determined by a forensic investigator that C had made up the allegation and doctored her appearance and harmed herself in order to add legitimacy to the claim. She was again sent home to us. We have begged every person, therapist, doctor, cps office, police officer etc to help us find a placement for her in an intensive treatment program before she seriously harms herself or succeeds in her suicide but have received nothing but more appointments with counselors.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to Sunday, once again we have discovered that C has been online engaging in relationships with older men and this time had been in contact with her mother. This time she stole her autistic sisters adaptive technology tablet that she uses to speak, hacked it so it would access the internet(voiding the warranty on the five thousand dollar device) to be able to carry on this behavior. We did our best to handle the situation without it turning into an attack from C, we thought everything was generally okay and went to bed with the plan of contacting her doctors, counselors, and therapists to let them know about the incident. Monday morning everything seemed fine, she got off to school like normal, her demeanor was typical for early morning. Thirty minutes later I get a call that C has vomited in class. I get the two little boys off on the bus and head to the school. C is pale and seems lethargic. I ask her what she thinks made her sick as she had seemed physically okay that morning, she said sour stomach, etc, etc, but I kept pressing because her speech was slurring. She then laughed and said, ""I took all my sleeping pills this morning you stupid bitch, now you get to watch me die."" We had made it home by this point so I immediately called 911, luckily we live near a local park that the ambulance drivers park when waiting on call so they arrived immediately and began care. I'm not going into details of what needed to be done to save her but I am sure you can imagine. The local hospital stabilized her and nurse brings out a handful of pages that were in her pocket that were her suicide notes. In the ""main"" note she said that she was raped when she was at her moms house for a summer visit when she was seven. I am crushed. I cannot even begin to put my feelings into words on this. I guess I was foolish to think that they would finally find a placement for C in a residential center so she could receive treatment for this trauma but no. She comes home tonight with no extra support put into place. I am going to be home alone with her and my three other children. I don't know that I can keep her safe. I don't want to bury my daughter. Please how can I get her the help she needs? We live in Northwest Missouri, USA. If anyone can send me information on resources located within the state of Missouri I would be forever grateful. I am just trying to save my daughters life. I don't want her to be kidnapped or kill herself.

838,"Why is living so exhausting? Hey everybody,

I finally competed my electrical apprenticeship after 5 years. It's great that I managed to finish however I am more depressed than ever.¬†

I have to say that doing an apprenticeship was probably one of my worst decisions I have ever made. I lost my job 3 times and worked the most tediously long hours (20 hour days were quite common) it destroyed me. My body is shot, I have next to no financial results, or gained any good contacts and networks to peruse this path further.

If I see another cable or even a light switch it makes me shudder. I have literally tortured myself for 5 years with everyone around me encouraging me to finish it, and now that I have, I simply look back with regret. I hate the work, the people and the environment I was surrounded with everyday.

I can't even do the job now without getting extremely angry and frustrated (not a good look for employers or clients). A simple cable run not going right will cause me to fume like nothing else.

I have worked many jobs and gained skills prior, as a network architect and a telecommunicatuons technician. I am now 33 years old and once again I have persued a career which I eventually hated with every fibre of my being.

My depression has become debilitating. I don't leave the house anymore unless really necessary. I have lost all my friends, and don't even do things with my wife and kids. My brother lives next door but never speak to him. I think he's given up on me too.¬†

I am unemployed and can't bring myself to look for work. The thought of being around people makes me want to die. Life seems so exhausting when people are involved and work is about people, either cooperating with or doing things for them.¬†

I really need to find a career I can tolerate. But there is nothing that pays for you to simply exist. And quite frankly existing is feeling lile work at the moment.

I am slipping further down the rabbit hole everyday.

Believe me when i say i woukd never act on these thoughts. But they dont feel normal to me.

I am looking forward to continuing it. It's astounding to look back through it and see what days we're my best - dates, job interviews, clean house, or generally just good days! Or, to look back and see bad days, such as terribly destructive days, over-thought days, being let go from a job, financially worries and the like.

842,"Very recent info about the newest iOS and iPhones concerns me with major mental health issues. Its recency seems to be part of why people haven't realized/cried out how serious it could be. A PSA: your iPhone might be subtly beautifying your selfies without telling you, and that is really concerning **EDIT:** As the whistleblower, it has come to my attention that I need to address some concerns/complaints proactively and also preemptively with the information I spread. This whistleblowing was initiated with the idea of setting aside one‚Äôs pride, self image, and judgment for the betterment of their neighbor, and I don‚Äôt intend to make an exception for myself. The addresses of the general issues are at the end of the post.

_____________________
In the name of good mental health, I have been spreading the word pretty much everywhere. This is copied from a post I did on my blog/social media, so the context might be weird, but the message is the same.

The article that inspired this writing can be found [here](). There are very clear differences in the photo evidence.

 

This is a call to action for everyone who reads this. I recently learned from an article on BusinessInsider that Apple seems to have implemented automatic photo retouching that beautifies selfies on the XS and other new models of the iPhone without telling the public. It will remove blemishes, smooth skin tone, and ultimately show you an idealized version of yourself.

At best it seems innocent, and Apple hadn‚Äôt considered that it could affect people‚Äôs self esteem.

At worst, and likely much more realistic, it affects many people‚Äôs self image, resulting in cognitive dissonance either with A: How they see themselves when not in their own pics B: How they see themselves in the eyes of others or C: Both.

You, the reader, may not specifically care when it involves just yourself. But this potentially has a huge negative impact in the world of mental health. Our society already has an abundance of body dysmorphia issues like bulimia, anorexia, those dudes who inject synthol to get fake muscles, general depression resultant of constantly comparing oneself to others etc.. We really don‚Äôt need to be forced to see an idealized version of ourselves that will never be attainable outside of our phone‚Ä¶..and potentially not even realize its happening. Not everyone is gonna read this and be informed about it; there may be a lot of people who take a selfie, see that version not realizing its retouched, then see themselves in the mirror at work or on a date, and subconsciously always feel like they can never measure up for some reason. Its not as simple as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt compare yourself to others.‚Äù That‚Äôs going to happen no matter what; at best that‚Äôs a suggestion, not a solution.

If Apple actually studied whether or not there could be mental health ramifications resultant of this, ok‚Ä¶.. that‚Äôs good. Maybe only 50% of people will have self-esteem issues from this, and maybe only 0.005% will have self esteem issues resulting from this. Even if only some people will be affected there‚Äôs still no good reason this should be the default setting. Right now, I‚Äôm calling on everyone who reads this to throw up a stink about it and tell their friends, write articles, post on all your social media, call your local news station‚Ä¶just do something. Even if you know 100% that you won‚Äôt personally be affected by it, you should at least be alarmed for the sake of the people around you who you care about and make sure other people are informed.

Until we know more about whether Apple looked into this themselves and whether it actually will impact people negatively, if you were only once in your life going to worry about the well being of the people around you, now (and even after) is the time to be worried. Yes, this could even turn out to be a good thing that somehow boosts everyone‚Äôs self esteem. But until we actually know, its time to sound the alarm and be concerned. Even if this is just the result of some glitch in a noise reduction algorithm, we all have a responsibility to make sure people are aware of the potential negative effects. Even if its as simple as copying this post and reposting it, this needs to be distributed, and people need to be informed.

I among many others have made jokes about mental health before, but right now is a time to get serious. When it gets this serious, mental health is no joke. Tell everyone.

**ADDRESSING OF ISSUES WITH MY WHISTLEBLOWING**

I would like to note ahead of time that some of these come from specific instances, but this is not to lampoon or even degrade those people. If anyone starts a witch hunt its just counterproductive. If you come across these concerns, consider them. The objective of this was never to convince anyone of a specific side or to be right: it was to inform, and weighing any argument is important in being properly informed.

1. **""There's no phd level psychological study!""** Not for this specifically, no, and I never claimed otherwise. But there is a HELL of a lot of study of body dysmorphia disorders like anorexia etc., which is what this whistleblowing is actually about. This is a concern of an extension of the social side of those disorders. Correcting some of my previous rushed data and according to recent data: (at least in the United States), 80% of teens are iOS users. This is also the demographic that learns about body dysmorphia issues in large part because it's the same age group where the problem begins to manifest. Ergo, 80% of this demographic is likely soon going to be using this *and might not know.* Additionally, 43% of Americans above age 13 are iOS users overall. That's a big chunk of the population, and socially-related mental issues don't just go away or fail to manifest once you're legally an adult. Globally, Apple may not have the majority market share, but that still doesn‚Äôt mean it's not a global issue. Global =/= equal spread among the entire world‚Äôs population. Also, talking about it is what is more likely to get it professionally studied.

2. **""This is borderline hysteria!""** I will admit that I made have been overly strong in my wording and reaction originally, but the sentiment does not change: people deserve to know. A company imposing appearance guidelines -- intentionally or unintentionally -- broadly on the public used to be something that only existed in dystopian sci-fi. That originally really unnerved me, and then I considered the real-world implications and got even more unnerved. This isn't a call to demand the software be removed or even to boycott Apple: its a call to inform others and be informed. I even readily acknowledge that it could turn out to be good. But until we know otherwise, its a good idea to err on the side of caution a lot of the time, considering we already know body image related mental health disorders are 100% a thing.

3. **""If you're the type of person who takes a lot of selfies anyway you might already have a problem.""** That may be true. That does not preclude this exacerbating their problem. Even if I/you personally think that type of behavior is dumb, now is not the time for that type of judgment.

4. **‚ÄúPeople have photos retouched/People use filters anyway.‚Äù** Yes, but they usually know that or do it themselves. Even if you‚Äôre getting professional shots done with a photographer and don‚Äôt know the process, you‚Äôre doing so because you understand that it will somehow look better. The problem isn‚Äôt the retouching, it's the lack of being informed.

5. **""The change is minimal.""** Yeah, but they still thought it important enough to implement. It's not going to turn someone with horrible acne into a movie star, but it will show your average person a version of themselves that doesn't actually exist without telling them. And the fact that the change is minimal and that you don‚Äôt know it's happening is the concern: if the changes were obvious and didn‚Äôt have to be examined in the first place, it wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near as disconcerting.

6. **""What about homelessness etc etc etc.""** The huge focus on this is directed at people who wouldn't be caring about their fellow man and those types of issues in the first place. If you want to care about multiple issues and do so often, go right ahead, but in the meantime if the only thing I can convince someone to care about is this issue, that's a win no matter what.

7. **Don‚Äôt spread the wrong information.** I am not calling on people to tell others ‚ÄúApple is messing with your mental health and they know it!‚Äù If you‚Äôve done that, please retract your statements: that is misinformation, which is pretty bad in itself. What I am calling on people to do, is inform themselves and inform others. A simple ‚Äúhey did you hear that your iPhone is retouching your selfies‚Äù to your best friend is better than nothing.

844,"I've really been feeling beaten down from the day-to-day grind. I use this ""dirty dishes challenge"" to help me keep my anxiety and frustration in check. Next time you do the dishes, clean the house, or do the laundry (insert your worst nightmare here), I have a challenge for you.

Do that frustrating thing in the best way you possibly can.

If you‚Äôre working on the dishes, turn on some music, focus in, and make sure every single dish is as clean as can be.

Skip the dishwasher for this round.

Try and enjoy this process.

This will help you with fixing real life problems, because‚Ä¶¬†Guess what?

**There are always going to be dirty dishes.**

That pile will be right there again tomorrow, with no sign of your previous efforts.

How maddening is that?

There will always be laundry and trash.

There will always be pain, hunger, financial issues, fights with family and friends, or what have you.

**So, do you just give up?**

It sure is an option.

You can contemplate the meaninglessness of your existence, and that gives you a pretty good excuse not to do the dishes.

But that comes with consequences, doesn‚Äôt it?

When you don‚Äôt work on solving your problems, your problems spread like weeds.

Gardens will always have weeds. It‚Äôs just your job to deal with them, so you can enjoy your garden.

If you want any chance at having a happy and healthy life, you can‚Äôt try and make the dishes go away forever.

That‚Äôs quite silly.

**The only sane thing to do is figure out how to enjoy doing the dishes.**

And that is very different from seeking the accomplishment you get from finishing the dishes.

There's an old story we can learn a lot from called the Myth of Sisyphus.

He was a man banished to hell, and his punishment was to roll a giant boulder up a hill.

As soon as he got close to the top, the boulder would roll all the way back down to the bottom, no matter how hard he pushed.

His only option was to try again, even knowing the eventual fate of his struggle against the boulder.

Unfortunately for the devil, Sisyphus found happiness.

He learned to love the struggle, to laugh at the absurdity of it.

**Our struggles are what give our lives meaning, what makes us stronger every day.**

850,"I (F19) have been having the worst few months of my life and don‚Äôt know what to do. First I feel I should mention that I have never been diagnosed with anything nor have I even seen any sort of therapist. I also have absolutely no way of being able to do so. 

So basically I‚Äôve been mildly suicidal for about the past 3 years? I‚Äôve come close to attempting several times (the last serious time was 2 years ago) I think about killing myself several times a day but have no actual drive to do so and I don‚Äôt self harm though I think about doing so often as well. I am regularly able to control myself and stop myself from crying or freaking out in public or even in private. I am currently enrolled in college and this semester in particular has been stressing me out more so than usual to the point that after every single class I sit in my car and cry, shake, and hyperventilate for anywhere from 20 minutes to about an hour. I have absolutely no drive to do any of my school work which is costing me greatly with my grades which of course only adds to my stress.
A month back I had some sort of breakdown or something? I had dropped everything and just left town and drove about 3-4 hours to a city over. Even today has been particularly awful and I spent over 2 hours straight crying. I have no idea what to do because all I want is to die. I have absolutely no interest in living anymore but I also don‚Äôt want to kill myself at all. I don‚Äôt know how to handle this.",1

She wakes up in the middle of the night ranting about how she's going to quit her job, wants to sell the house, get a divorce, etc. She hints at suicide. If I suggest therapy, she gets defensive, and a fight ensues. This isn't who she is. I'm at the end of my rope. I want to help her but I don't know how.

857,"Some really great apps for mental health! I wanted to just put this out there for anyone who might need it. If something like this has been posted before I apologize. Here are two apps I love:

*Daylio*:helps you track your mood day to day, week to week, month to month. This is great if you are starting a new medication, changing your dose, trying to track triggers etc. it lets you add comments and notes so if you are having a particularly rough day, you can note whether anything of significance happened, any intrusive thoughts you had, things like that! It also generates charts based on your data which can give you a realistic idea of how you are doing overall.

*Wisdo*: this is basically a social media app designed specifically for people struggling with a condition, trauma, or problem. You create an account, select from certain groups, and are instantly connected with thousands of other people who are struggling with the same thing! 

If anyone has more suggestions, I‚Äôd be happy to add them as a reference for people who might need them. 

Take care of yourselves! :)

~EDIT: Thanks to everyone who has contributed their own suggestions! They are added below. And thank you for the 2 silvers! Very appreciated :)~
_____________________________________________________________________________

App suggestions from the comments section!:

*Moodpath* (suggested by arianope and jojogonzo)- this is also a mood tracker but with this one, it asks you 3 questions a day and comes with the added benefit of suggesting therapy based on what you log (so if you're new / never been to a therapist or psychiatrist-definitely check this one out)

*Insight timer* (suggested by stonedandopinionated) This is a meditation app! It promotes mindfulness and as a result, helps decrease negative emotions. (Meditation is great for all forms of mental health!)

*Youper* (suggested by EllieWithTheTea) This is an app that connects you with an AI as a means of getting out the negative emotions, but also to suggest things that might help(I've never heard of anything like it!) Youper has guided meditations and a mood tracker in-app. 

*Diaro* (suggested by that-weird-dude) This is a diary app! that-weird-dude says he reads over what he's written before therapy sessions to remember what's been happening (awesome idea by the way)

*iMood* (suggested by Dig_Douglas) another mood-tracking app! This one offers a 1-10 scale to log how you are feeling. It also has notes that you can add to each entry.

*Calm Harm* (suggested by Noctulecent) for those with self harm issues.
It basically gives you activities to do when you feel the urge to self harm, you can choose the time you do it until you feel better.It‚Äôs a good distraction. I know I get stuck on things to do to ride out the wave so it‚Äôs good for giving you ideas and counting it down with you.",1
858,"Long Distance GF's memory suddenly wiped My long distance girlfriend has suffered from a complete memory wipe and she is only 21 years old. Her parents are divorced and she had physical, sexual, and mental abuse from those who were suppose to be there to love and support her. She is half way across the world in South East Asia.

She has been working 2 jobs for the past 2 weeks, 16 hour days because she wants to earn enough money to go to university and leave the country that she's in asap. She's been extremely stressed, and she has a history of migraines. Particularly recently, she was complaining about memory issues, where she can't remember various details such as how long she's been living in South East Asia, how old I am, or the fact that we had a conversation 12 hours earlier.

36 hours ago, we were texting during her evening and my morning. She just finished her second job for the day and went out with her coworkers. I was asking about her day and within 30 minutes, she told me that she doesn't remember anything, she has a headache, and and all she knows is that she loves me. Afterwards, it became clear to me that her memories were wiped clean. She knows her name, what she looks like, and her age (barely on the last one). She didn't remember who her mom was, what her interests were, or who she was hanging out with that very night. She obviously didn't remember who I was or what I looked like, but only knew that she had a warm feeling about me. She has looked at previous photos of us together, and felt happy even though I was ""a stranger"".

**Edit: She mentioned that her memory seems ""foggy""**

Currently, she is sleeping but her headache is still there. She mentioned before bed that there was a throbbing sensation behind her left eye, and it goes to the back of her neck. My heart is shattered right now, and there isn't much I can do given my physical situation.

Has there been any cases of this? Will she regain her memory? If not, how can she proceed from here?

863,"I wish mental illness was terminal (life-limiting) First of all, I'm not downplaying the horrors of having a terminal illness. Most people don't want to have an illness that causes death. And I understand that.

But here are my thoughts.

I, personally, wish that mental illness caused death (excluding suicide). I wish the pain would come to an end. It's unfair that we get an illness that makes us suffer to the point where we wish we were dead, but yet it's like ""nope, no release, you have to consciously suffer for the rest of your life... Sorry!"" It's so cruel. 

Imagine being stabbed in the heart over and over and never dying. If you didn't want to die before, after the first or second stab you'll change your mind!

I mean what the actual fuck? Doesn't this seem cruel and fucked up to anyone else?",1
864,"Scared of losing my brother I am 16 my brother is 10, and I love him more than anything in this world.

Some background: I had a friend in 8th grade who committed suicide at age 13, and we all knew his older brother. For some reason, after that happened I have been afraid that I will end up like the older brother. Additionally, I was with my friend at lunch the day he died, and have always felt heavy guilt for not reading signs, or texting him, even though I was only 13 and struggling myself. 

My brother was put in a hospital last year for suicidal tendencies, when he was 9, because of his school. It was a mess for my family, because we are all so close. Some things that he said will haunt me forever and I can't believe my baby brother felt like that. He was at a hospital miles away from us for like 3 days, it was horrible.
Finally, I have been inpatient and outpatient many times for suicidal ideation and self harm since the age of 14, and when this happened I had just finished an intensive outpatient program. I was still severely depressed at this point and rarely attending school.

So with these 3 things combined, I feel like I am overly protective of my brother. I am so scared that I will just lose him like my friends brother lost him. Knowing how close I've come to killing myself, I relate and am terrified that he will try again. This makes no sense though, because he changed schools and went through therapy and he is doing great now, living that 10 year old life. But I feel like I'm scared to leave him alone sometimes. 

I feel like I have to check on him all the time, especially before I go to bed , or after he gets really angry. My biggest fear is that I will find him and he won't be alive. Even though he is doing so much better now, I love him to death and I think my past experiences have scarred me so much that I just irrationally act this protective. I know he is okay, but sometimes I feel overwhelming fear. 

Is it normal? 
Any insight or similar experience is appreciated.

865,"I actually see a future worth fighting for Hey r/mentalhealth I'm not sure if this fits here so feel free to tell me if I'm wrong.

So after years of abusive parents (mentally, physically and emotionally), being bullied and being lonely I actually feel like there is a future. Earlier this year I decided enough is enough, so I packed my shit and left to live with my girlfriend with her family (with her families permission ofcourse). It was strange, growing up I never knew that a family can be kind and loving but after being here they taught me that. They showed me the true meaning of family. They understood my struggles in my past home and always tell me to stop apologizing (I do it alot out of habit because i feel like everything i do is a mistake). Then recently I came to the realization that there is something to live for. I've lived so many years of attempted overdose, hanging, self mutilation. I lived life just hoping something would end my pathetic existence. But yesterday me and my partner received out rent application approval are finally going to move out to our own place. I've never been more happy in my life. I finally have something. I'm off my medication and I've never felt so alive.

874,"How do I support a family member who witnessed a shooting? Hi folks.

So a couple weeks ago, my young cousin (just started high school) was present for one of the mass shootings here in the US. They heard the first shots fired (even heard a young child remarking about the shots, saying they were firecrackers), and booked it when they realized what was happening.

They heard everything.

They were a few hours away from home, and of course the area was on lockdown, so they couldn't go home right away. They eventually returned, safe and unharmed, a few hours later.

Their mother (single parent, my father's sister) refuses to talk about it with them (to be fair, she don't know English all that well). They wrote the entire description of the events down on paper, and gave it to people to read if they wanted to. They're pretty quiet usually, but my sibling and I can sense that they are incredibly shaken up about it. My father even knows how distressed they are.

However, both their mother and my father seem to refuse counseling or any sort of therapy for them. My sibling and I have begged them to consider it and at least give them \*the choice\* of talking to someone (because this is their decision to make). We don't know what their healthcare situation is (their mother is unemployed) so we don't even know if anything is available for them. My father says he'll handle it, but he's dragging his feet, that's if he's doing anything at all. They're going to the same high school my sibling and I went to, and we know that the counselors there are overwhelmed because of the sheer number of students they have to handle (several hundred per counselor).

Both my sibling and I are full-time college students, and I'm home maybe 80-90 non-continuous days of the year. We're going to try to provide support for them if they want it, and we're giving them some material goods (some electronics, new clothes, etc) for Christmas this year (them and their mother don't have working income, and usually rely on my family and hand-me-downs for belongings).

Is there anything I can do? Is there anything I should do? Any and all help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.",1

She's seen it briefly before but seeing it this time she thinks it's definitely not normal because I become completely neutral and oblivious to everything around me and episodes like this in the past have lasted up to several days, although I've thought nothing of it. Once a woman wanted me to hit her in bed (some unexpected BDSM) and my brain went into meltdown, I stopped watching any porn for several months. 

She thinks it might have something to do with the fact I grew up in a highly emotionally and physically abusive household where I would shut out a lot of negative verbal abuse from my mother and relatives.

Only you experience existence your way. And think otherwise is the real shared delusion.

Hello, I've posted here before saying that things in my life weren't going well and I was feeling down. Most people suggesting seeing a therapist but I don't have the time or money for it. I feel suffocated by life and it's responsibilities. Every day I go to work, class, back to work, study and then bed. My life feels monotonous and I'm not really enjoying things. But I need the money and I need to get my classes done so I have no choice. During the regular school term, my life was all structured around work, academic responsibilities, and my family. I didn't have time for anything else.   


I don't have people in my personal life to turn to. My parents are frequently stressed about money and their failing relationships so I feel burdensome talking to them. my parents also don't understand how I feel, they tend to think it's a product of me overreacting or believe it's a mindset issue. I have plenty of friends but I don't have any close friends. I also know that I am the least exciting friend that turns group hangouts down for work so my friends have stopped inviting me out.  


I also struggle to tell my friends because life just seems so much easier for them. And I know that's dumb to say and I know that I will never entirely understand what they're going through but it all seems easier. They all have more money and parents that will support them even if they're not working. School comes easy to them and when they barely put in any effort, they get the same grades as me even though I'm constantly studying. I don't think they'd understand because their lives are just different.  


Anyway, on a much more serious note, I have been thinking about suicide daily. I have always thought about it in some shape or form but for the last year, I feel like every time things seem like they're getting slightly better I get slapped in the face with another difficult obstacle. I don't even get excited when things start to look better because I know something new is going to appear and ruin things again. I know life is just a series of ups and downs but I feel helpless knowing I'm always going to feel this miserable the thought that I'm going to keep feeling this way for the rest of my life just makes me want to disappear. I constantly wonder whether life is worth continuing if it's all just one big let down. the only thing that keeps me from killing myself is knowing that I might make my family sad or put them through unnecessary medical/burial costs. I don't have any current plans to kill myself but it's beginning to feel like more or an option every day. I'm tired of feeling so helpless all the time.   


If you could offer some advice on how to cope with these feelings, I would greatly appreciate it.",1

891,"Stop blaming yourself As someone in therapy, I'd like to share the few tips I think that apply to everyone with mental health issues, and the biggest problem a lot of people have is blaming themselves. It's common in people who have addictions, emotional trauma, are socially way behind for their age, etc. They feel like ""I'm so lazy/worthless, if I'd have just put more effort in, I'd be where I need to be"". Or they adopt beliefs of natural inferiority, they think they have ""bad genetics"" or are just naturally weak in some way.

Guess what? Those are false beliefs. If you had lots of trauma growing up, the effects are real. It's 100% proven that unstable formative/early life experiences can have effects that are extreme in nature. Your work ethic, social life, ability to form/maintain relationships, self control and overall happiness WILL be affected, and it was out of your control. 

Most people with huge social problems in their 20s or older, before properly speaking to a professional, tend to attribute around 80% of the blame of their situation to themselves. In reality, it's closer to 20%. That 20% accounts for only a few things - yes, you could have made more effort, like anybody. Yes, after a certain age you have more control over your actions. Yes, the future and getting better is largely determined by your actions right now. But the fact is, the trauma stunts your ability to do these things, not permanently, but certainly for someone who went through a lot, it's ridiculous to feel like a genuine loser for being behind, if you have had some terrible or emotionally alienating realities in your life. The blame lies partially with the World having fucked up elements, your immediate environment, and if you had parents or carers who had also experienced trauma, in some ways you got caught in their cycle. Blaming your parents etc, to some degree is unhealthy (they were responsible for you, but may have been abused themselves, so try to look at that 50/50).

So the key is, give yourself some psychological slack. You'll need it for the work in recovery. The building blocks of living and eating healthy and exercising and expanding your horizons socially are all important, but that journey will fail if you carry a chip on your shoulder of feeling personally responsible for having a hard go of it. Remember, yes, negativity and harsh times exist, but so does the positive, and you aren't confined or relegated to the negativity, ever. Move onwards and upwards. Thanks for reading",1

The wood is a bit damp so its a job to get the fire going. Looked through my books to see if there was any I could live without, and there it was... a book about depression. I've had it for years. Read it a few times but it never helped.

So I've been a white nationalist since my mid-early teens (my parents were really nice, they had nothing to do with it), I can't pinpoint the moment when it all started but I remember that I started listening to far-right speeches and I realized that I agreed with their message, then I started listening to far-right music (RAC and NSBM), then I started reading far-right online newspapers and just one year ago I adopted the skinhead look (Doc Martens, fly jacket etc), Even here on reddit, I've been following communities like r/whitebeauty and r/fashwave . I'm not really open about it irl, I've been generally quiet and distant since always.


But recently I made the realization that following the far-right only made me more marginalized, more miserable and It will certainly only cause problems for me in the future (on finding a job, a partener and all that). So I want to change but It's not that easy, leaving all those beliefs behind. I'm open to questions and suggestions

I am approaching quarter life and time to get serious about being an adult. I am a female, and I realize I am poor at making life decisions such as career goals and picking university majors. I am also quite sensitive. I get VERY anxious making such decisions. The thing is I am quite smart and good at seeing the pros and cons of everything. But then I start to find the grass greener on the other sides. Then I find that neither decision is as pleasant and I look for other alternatives. And what ends up happening is I never make the decision, never put myself in difficult situations and let life go on for me. And then I come out realizing I am never where I want to be and how the last little while was a complete waste of time for me. Or realizing how I never realistically approached my goals. I sometimes look at what others do and use their experiences to guide my thinking too. And then I ask myself who the hell am I and what do I want out of life! I feel completely lost in everything, I don't even have my own hobbies or things I do for fun. I am a fun social girl, better looking than average, but realized my real life is not what I wanted.

I have had a small relationship in the past, and that ended because of long distance.

Wow I don't know where I am going with this. I am a hard worker and I am very smart and could do well in whatever I do.

But I am not satisfied with where I am now and I don't even know what my next steps should be.

905,"First day out of psychiatric hospital, advice? Hi!
Last week I voluntarily admitted myself in the hospital, I got out of an abusive relationship overnight, moved back in with my parents who on day #3 of me moving back informed me that they are getting a divorce. Already having been diagnosed with panic disorder, dependent personally disorder, and ocd it was heartbreaking. My whole world was shattered and my anxiety took control. I couldn‚Äôt give my children 100% with my anxiety the way it was and on day #4 of living with my parents, I called the hospital and told them I‚Äôm on my way. My parents put their differences aside for a week and took care of them. This place was nice and I made a lot of friends, it was also very traumatizing and I saw WAY MORE then I could handle but I made it! 6 medications later, and I‚Äôm finally back home. My parents are still divorcing (obviously) and my dad is still collecting my stuff from my ex so I don‚Äôt have to see him.

907,"After a suicide attempt that landed me in hospital for days and 2 and a half years of grappling with my mental health and wanting to die, I have a job and I'm going to college. It's such a huge step for me and I just want to share with people who know what the struggle is like. Hi this got rather long but it's worth the read I promise!! I barely use social media besides Reddit and some Twitter but I've been sharing this like everywhere I can, sadly I don't have very many friends so I could use someone else to get excited with. This community actually understands the struggle that is suffering at the hands of your own brain, so I thought this would be a nice place. 

Also I'm British, so by college I mean the school you go to at 16-18 not 18+ as that's uni for us :) But I'm 18 now so I'm a few years behind. That's why this is so exciting! Following a suicide attempt that landed me in hospital for days, my mum pulled me out of highschool mere months before my GCSEs which I regret so much even though I barely had a say because I was an A* student in spite of having bad depression and anxiety and then undiagnosed Asperger's and OCD. I spent 2 and a half years grappling with my mental health after that. The first 9 months or so I hardly ever left my house. I didn't see anyone, I had no friends to talk to, I didn't go out or do anything. I half assed some online courses you have to do as legally I had to be in schooling or work until I turned 18, but most of the time I cried, watched TV, binge ate, and hated myself. I struggled with suicidal thoughts still but was too numb to even do anything about them. I was nearly dead as it was, merely existing.

In November 2017, after my mum had me applying for jobs because I just sat on my arse and after a lot of rejections, I got a job at McDonald's. At first I was humiliated. I was an A* student and the prejudice in my classes was astounding; my teachers joked about us working in such places as if it'd be the biggest tragedy. But eventually I came to accept that hey, it's a job, I managed to get a job. For once I had a reason to get up and out of the house, explore the city centre of my city a bit (I didn't know my way around my own city because of a rather sheltered and restrictive upbringing) and get some real experience. And as expected, the work itself was dreadful. Minimum wage to suffer abuse from customers, really taxing work and triggers to my mental health. But I am so thankful I worked there for the year I did. I learned people skills on the tills and from talking to coworkers, I gained confidence when coworkers would take a liking to the previously bullied and friendless me and talked to me over shifts. I learned I'm a hard worker and an efficient one. I eventually left because it was a sensory nightmare, but I learned a lot. First big step to my recovery. I went out more, got more into buying clothes and makeup to express myself, made a new best friend who isn't really talking to me now which is sad who I explored other cities with. I finally felt alive. I got my old DSLR and took pictures of York and Manchester and kept my train tickets. Finally felt like I was becoming an adult. My parents hardly let me go anywhere before. It was freeing.

After I left, there was a bit of limbo where I felt lost. I developed a passion for computer science, decided I wanted to be a pentester, and lost that passion all in 2 months. Life felt hectic and hard to handle and I was very overwhelmed, every day. Spent ¬£300 on a new laptop and used my ¬£1000 I'd saved for ages (well I used about ¬£800 in about 6 months) whilst I tried to think. My mum encouraged me to go to a college for adult learners and do my English and Maths GCSEs which I did and get the grades for in a week and a half. Only person in the whole course to sit the higher level papers. During this time I also met my boyfriend. We met online, we're long distance as he lives in Ireland and I England but we fell in love rather quickly. He came to visit me not even 2 months after we started talking and it was amazing. I was mildly overwhelmed but he knew about my mental health and made every effort to make things easy for me. I knew right then he was perfect for me. It's been rocky at times but we're coming up on 7 months together as of Monday and I am so in love with him. I really couldn't be happier. He's supported me a shit ton and I support him too. He encouraged me to go to a job interview for a mail sorting position; amazing pay, 20 hours a week (4 hours every evening Monday to Friday), warehouse environment. I can put my headphones in and go off sorting mail and it's not too taxing because of the hours. I got the job and I LOVE IT. It's so perfect for me. I truly believe he was a big motivation in that. The other week they told me my 6 month temporary contract had been made a permanent one. So I make pretty good money weekly, which is nice. I still have a lot of free time in the days, although my parents hate that because they complain I sit on my arse all day doing fuck all. I try to get out and enjoy myself.

I picked up cross stitching. I picked up piano. I finally found a therapist with some availability (surprisingly difficult when you go private, also the prices per session wowie who needs accessibility). I start seeing her very soon. And after some direction and encouragement from my boyfriend and a lot of feeling lost about what I wanna do, a trip to the Science and Industry museum in Manchester and handling samples in my job I remembered my insane passion for the sciences in school and my high grades in them. I used to want to be a doctor but I'm extremely squeamish about blood and certain areas of the body (like the part of your arm they take blood from, thinking about it too much makes me squirm) but I'd still like to be part of a field which helps people. I realised researching and analysing would fit me well and inquired at what was my first choice college back in highschool about my best options. Well they finally got back to me this morning saying that my circumstances were interesting and that since I only have my English and Maths GCSEs I can't do A Levels but I can do Applied Science Level 2 (and later 3) which will enable me to go on to do a degree in uni. I'll also be doing some GCSEs on the side. 

I could not be more excited. My boyfriend is visiting me right now and he was there when I got the news and neither of us could stop smiling. I'm fucking going to college!!! After 2 years of thinking I have no place in this world, being confused about my path in life, thinking I was just lazy and had no dreams, I'm going to be studying biochemistry and all 3 core sciences (physics, biology and chemistry) and work towards my dream. I'm so happy and just want other people to be as proud as I feel.

Sorry this got so ridiculously long but I feel proud and wanted to share my story. Honestly it's been really hard but I'm glad I stuck with it even on the days I was just kinda drifting through life as a zombie. I'm beaming as I write this right now.

909,"I'm incredibly desperate, I have no idea what's wrong with me and would like to know if anyone here might have any ideas.  This is my first post and it's terrifying to post it. I'm sorry it's so long.

Um I really don‚Äôt know how to organize this, it probably won‚Äôt be that coherent but I‚Äôm just really desperate at this point and would like to know if anyone might have any ideas what exactly could be the issue. So all in all, thankyou for your time if you read this. I‚Äôm already panicking at the thought of anyone reading this for many reasons, I‚Äôd like to ask anyone reading this to try and separate me myself from certain actions I‚Äôll be mentioning.

Alright so, I‚Äôm certain that when it comes to mental health, all details of significance are worth mentioning so here‚Äôs a brief background on my short life. I‚Äôm 16, female, an only child, I‚Äôve never felt ANY romantic or sexual feelings towards anything or anyone which is frustrating in its own right, however this is potentially a result of my medication. I‚Äôm prescribed Daytrana which is a brand of Methylphenidate. I‚Äôve been on this for my ADHD since I was diagnosed when I was extremely young. It comes in the form of a patch that is placed on the hip every morning and taken off every night, done everyday just with alternate sides each time. Sorry if you already knew this but from my experiences not many people know of Daytrana so I felt like explaining. I‚Äôm diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder, Bipolar type 2, PTSD, Depression(though this seems to be intertwined with the other disorders), and ADHD as previously stated. Multiple professionals I‚Äôve talked to brought up the possibility of me having OCD due to constant counting, checking and needing to redo things a certain number of times(mainly 5 and other multiples of it) such as sentences, closing doors, flipping switches, eating and drinking, and so on and so forth. I dislike self-diagnosing so I‚Äôm just considering it a possibility and either way it‚Äôs not anywhere near my main concern. 

Okay. A big thing I‚Äôve been needing to bring up is information about my father, but I just couldn‚Äôt think of a smooth way to do so, so I‚Äôll just spring into it this way. My father killed himself, he shot himself on March 5th, 2017 while drunk. There is SO much that goes into this so I apologize if it‚Äôs painfully dry to read. This was his 6th **known** attempt. He had tried when I was an infant, many, MANY times before and after I was born and his mental health deteriorated the older he got. He wasn‚Äôt even very old, he was 30 years older than I am, and was 42 when he passed. I blame myself and can‚Äôt stop doing so due to me being the last person he spoke to. I was a bratty 13 year old and I didn‚Äôt treat him very well considering he didn‚Äôt do so towards me. He suffered from depression, anxiety, ADHD, and Bipolar Type 1. He was definitely a narcissist. When I was young(around 10 and younger) I went through a phase of running away from my house(s) due to not being able to handle the fighting anymore. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave my bedroom and had to go straight to it whenever I got home. My father didn‚Äôt want to deal with me and my mother wanted to make sure I was out of my dad‚Äôs range so I ended up being neglected. He‚Äôd tell me things like I was ‚Äúasking to be raped‚Äù because I had worn a skirt at age 11, and whenever I ran away he‚Äôd say things like ‚Äúlet the bitch go‚Äù. There is so much more but frankly I‚Äôm tired of writing it and you‚Äôre probably tired of reading it. More details about his death though. He was going through his second Cancer. His first was Salivary Gland Cancer which took 2 years for chemo. His second was Colon, which is strange considering how young he was. He shot himself the day before his 7th(final) round of chemotherapy for it, which would‚Äôve been the more painful according to his experiences with the treatment priorly. I know his illness is probably a large contributor to why he decided to do it, however the fact that my final words to him were something along the lines of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like talking to a fucking drunkard, so bye.‚Äù and then hanging up. This was at the point where Leafy was still an active YouTuber and saying ‚Äúkill yourself‚Äù or ‚Äúkys‚Äù were common, I‚Äôd sprinkled one of those in there somewhere too I know. I regret these words but cannot take them back, and that sums up all details of significance from my past, ugh it sounds so over the top when I say it that way. Moving on.

Here‚Äôs where the serious issues come into play. This is going to be a mess to write so I apologize in advance. Also I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying that almost all of this information comes from my mother and other ‚Äúwitnesses‚Äù. Ahhhh Oh god this is so difficult to write I‚Äôm so frustrated by all of this. Anyways whatever I‚Äôll just get to it in rambling fashion so there will most likely be grammatical errors ahead. It has always been incredibly difficult to wake me up and I‚Äôm so grateful to have such a wonderful, patient, caring, supportive, and loving mother like I do, otherwise I‚Äôd be utterly screwed. She spends a little under 1 hour every single day just trying to wake me up. Until eventually I just get up normally. My mothers single and works very high up for the largest power company in our area so she‚Äôs a very busy lady and doesn‚Äôt have the time to spend more than what she does trying to get me awake. Due to this I have missed ALOT of school, not to mention how difficult going to school was already due to my anxiety disorder. In my freshman year I went 3 days in September, once in October, and then went to a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù school from April twentieth-something onwards, still missing a large amount of days. It‚Äôs a miracle I passed to be honest. But the thing that bothers me most. Is the fact that when trying to wake me up, I‚Äôm active. I will 1) Respond the conversations, 2) Get up and walk around, 3) Become violent. Very violent. The scariest part is that I am not conscious for ANY of it. I‚Äôm thankful my mother doesn‚Äôt blame me for it when she has the full right to. When asleep I am incredibly abusive and remember none of it. I‚Äôll spew every offensive word I know at whoever else is physically there. My mother‚Äôs white, yet I‚Äôve allegedly called her racial slurs of more than one culture. My mother is a heterosexual female, yet I‚Äôve called her slurs for homosexual males. But I‚Äôd call her every derogatory word in existence a million times over if it meant I‚Äôd stop unknowingly giving her giant(larger than a baseball) black and blue marks. I‚Äôve almost given her a concussion twice. There are also a lot of bite marks. I want to stop doing this, I know surprising right, so back in October an appointment was scheduled with a neurologist. That appointment came up a few weeks ago. It went terribly. I had been terrified for it for months, I was scared to know if there was something wrong. But I was even more scared that it would come up that there wasn‚Äôt. The doctor I met with didn‚Äôt take the meeting seriously. He specialized in the ‚Äúphysical‚Äù neurological issues and didn‚Äôt exactly believe in mental illness. Once he was told I have ADHD, he spent the rest of the appointment forcing his beliefs onto me about how ADHD isn‚Äôt real and that I wasn‚Äôt exhibiting any signs of it. You know, perhaps I wasn‚Äôt displaying symptoms because the medication I was currently wearing was working?? Big frickin‚Äô shocker there huh. He also examined my whole body and when he got to my arm he brought up my scars (there very deep and not very uniform considering I use scissors) and held up my arm, he looked and smiled at me, and started teasing me about them while chuckling. Saying things along the lines of ‚Äúohhhh did the cat do these?‚Äù ‚Äúyeahhhh the cat did these haha‚Äù. At this point I broke and began bawling my eyes out. I felt gross, my face was covered in sweat, tears, and snot. I started to panic and didn‚Äôt want to scream in a place like this so I bit my wrist and other parts of my hand, along with my knee. I drew blood this time and my wrist has felt odd ever since, as if all the stuff inside it got tangled up around the protruding bone and my veins feel weak. He then started to mock me for crying and continued telling me ADHD wasn‚Äôt real. The appointment ended in him saying I was ‚Äúperfectly normal‚Äù and I should stop drinking iced tea. I don‚Äôt drink iced tea. He gave me homework, ‚ÄúResearch Twenty Benefits of Laughing and Smiling‚Äù. I felt extremely hopeless. I‚Äôm going to have tests done in November. I don‚Äôt remember the name of the process but it involves scans and being hooked up to it for like 48 hours or something. I just really want to know if anyone has any idea what my behaviors while being ‚Äúasleep‚Äù might be. Oh yeah I forgot to mention that on multiple occasions, friends I was with reported that I sorta ‚Äúsnapped‚Äù and ran the hell away screaming and crying to myself wide-eyed about something following me and watching me. A few years back at an event with my 4 friends it happened. It was at the SteelStacks venue thing which is basically an old steel factory with a lot of bridge walkway things and stairs to view it well. According to two of my friends, I was with them walking around on the bridge looking at the place before I just randomly darted away from them running and screaming. I apparently didn‚Äôt recognize them and avoided them due to terror. I ran all the way to a casino parking lot, tried to climb the fence and ended up cutting myself on it, curling up into a ball on the dirt under two pine trees in the fetal position crying about how ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt find me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm okay they aren‚Äôt here‚Äù and trying to stay quiet so they wouldn‚Äôt find me. One of the two ran after me, the other ran back to the other 2 to tell them what happened. They contacted my mom and told her to come get me which she did and I had retaliated in a parking lot before she dragged me into the car. My eyes were wide and bloodshot, my eyebrows were furrowed, my face was constantly twitching and I was whispering things to myself. I remained this way the entire drive home. At this point I remember vague bits of the event through my own eyes. I remember how dark everything was, how distorted everything especially other people looked, and how no matter where I ran I saw a black figure in the distance facing towards me. I remember going batshit and screaming my head off whenever my eyes fell upon it. I hung out with the two who I had run away from a few weeks ago and when reminiscing on it one of them had asked what exactly happened, and when trying to explain that I wasn‚Äôt conscious during the entirety of it, she just kept insisting ‚Äúbut you were‚Äù. I gave up and the conversation ended. The final thing I‚Äôll mention is how often I feel dormant within my body. Everything around me feels ‚Äúloud‚Äù and like its all pounding into my being. I find myself naked often and when seeing myself in the mirror during these episodes my face constantly twitches. Like my eyes rapid blink but not always both simultaneously, my nose wrinkles up again and again, my mouth twitches up on both sides(I hope you know what I mean by this), my eyebrows refuse to stay unfurrowed, my entire body trembles freakishly, I continually scratch my head and my hair becomes very ratty, I tend to curl my arms up frequently in odd thrashing motions, whenever walking anywhere my eyes dart all around me  again and again as if I‚Äôm expecting something to be around watching me, lastly I end up becoming infatuated with staring at my reflection and digesting it. Feelings of shock come out as I feel like I look like some disturbed monster rather than myself. I hear whispers in the back of my head of conversations I can‚Äôt make out, I hear thuds and doors/windows opening and closing, along with the sound of someone urinating into a toilet(like a stream of water hitting a pool of water and echoing, like the sound of urination from how I hear it). These episodes bother me at first and I check around my entire house for where they‚Äôre coming from which always end up being a futile effort considering they aren‚Äôt really coming from anywhere specifically. Another strange thing I‚Äôd like to add relating to this is this one type of episode I have. Things similar to this have occurred a few times but I‚Äôll mention the most alarming and prominent one. Last November, I was in my bathroom and began cleaning out the drain of my sink with Q-Tips. This was done in silence which is strange since I‚Äôm always listening to music or on the phone with my best friend. The cleaning itself is somewhat bizarre but that‚Äôs not the part that scares me about it. I was like this for 11 hours straight. I was naked the entire time. I was also on my period. When I came to, I was covered in urine and blood from it and my legs were stained red. I remembered none of the cleaning besides what I could put together with the information I had. I feel this isn‚Äôt normal behavior of a person. Maybe I‚Äôm conceited in thinking that but I really just want to know what the hell is wrong. The doctor I met with had no interest in actually helping me and intimidated me to much for me to share all the details properly. So I decided to do so here. Sorry that some parts of this were as gross as they were, I felt they were necessary though. So all in all, please, please, **please**, if anyone might know what the hell is going on with my brain please let me know. I‚Äôm desperate. Sorry this was so terribly long, thankyou to anyone who read it all, I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. I‚Äôm incredibly scared about posting this but I suppose I‚Äôll just do it.

916,"Thank goodness for people who understand I‚Äôm at a theme park today with my boyfriend and his family. I don‚Äôt handle crowds very well, especially when there‚Äôs a ton of noise. On top of this we have our two dogs with us, and I was walking out littlest one. She‚Äôs not used to her leash yet so she was pulling on the leash non stop and barking a lot and that was overwhelming for me too.

So not even 20 minutes into walking through the park, I start to feel that dreaded panic/drowning feeling creeping in and taking over my mind. all the noise and the people and everything all at once took over my brain and I couldn‚Äôt hear anything my boyfriend said to me over all the chaos and I couldn‚Äôt put words together and then it all reached the fucking peak and I burst into tears. I started hyperventilating and crying uncontrollably, and my boyfriend and his brother were forced to stop and deal with me.

All I wanted to do was hide. I was so embarrassed and that feeling of humiliation just perpetuated and intensified the panic. I had no control and nowhere to hide. People everywhere, every single one seemed to be looking at me concerned or bewildered or weirded out, and my boyfriend and his brother obviously had no idea what to do and I just kept repeating ‚Äúa bathroom, please, where‚Äôs a bathroom‚Äù because I needed privacy ASAP. But me repeating that was definitely stressing my boyfriend out even more because he‚Äôd already told me over and over he doesn‚Äôt know where one is and that he was trying to find a map, but I couldn‚Äôt hear him answering me over all the chaos. 

Finally I spotted a little tattoo shop that looked empty, so I ran to it and hid inside, still hyperventilating and crying. After a minute the girl working the shop approached me and asked if I needed to talk. I managed to tell her I was having a panic attack, and she said she just had one too about a week ago and let me know I could stay there as long as I needed, and I could also go to the medic and they would be able to help me too.

923,"my brother is a shit  

I was abused by my brother growing up and found out recently that I have PTSD. It's not the usual brotherly fights, he's 8 years older than me and I remember getting beaten down, smashed against tables and choked against the walls for doing pretty much nothing. The abuse started when I was in first grade and he was in high school. He even beat me with a textbook once when I was in 5th grade (imagine a 10-year-old getting beaten by an adult) , perhaps he thought he could literally beat the knowledge into me. I recall planning to kill him with poison and keeping a knife under my pillow when I was 9 YEARS OLD. Looking back at it, it's fucking crazy that a child that young has to think of murdering someone and keeping a knife under his pillow in fear. This man gave me hell, I was trapped, stressed and helpless for my entire childhood. No child should live under those circumstances.

My parents knew what was going on but they refused to do anything. My mom had school and my father was just a pussy that just stood there when my brother got in one of his fits. For example, whenever he would beat me, nothing was done, not even a slap on the wrist. He would always play victim and if I made it to my dad I would just use him as a barrier while my father just stood there. In 7th grade, my brother started bashing on one of my friends and then I told him, ""at least I have friends"". This set him off and he wouldn't let me in the house. When my dad made him move out the way he punched a hole in our wall. Believing that he broke his arm, my dad then decided that everything was my fault and punched me in the face. I'm not even exaggerating, this fool actually decked me in the face.

Childhood trauma has given me PTSD, sleep issues, and many other issues that are fucking with my mental and physical heath. I even have urinating issues that doctors believe was caused by my abuse. I'm 18 now and all these health issues are finally getting to me and I can barely focus on my studies. I honestly feel like how I was as a child except that even when this guy can't beat the shit out of me anymore, he still is. I feel like I'm in a hole and that if these sicknesses don't go away then I'm fucked for life. I haven't had a decent sleep in forever (6 years), my mental cognition is deteriorating as I'm starting to forget everything and it's difficult for me to learn. My head burns all the time and I've been thinking about suicide a lot recently.

Nobody in my family has taken fault or apologized for what's happened. My mom has but I really don't blame her, she's the breadwinner of our family and she didn't have the time for our family when I was a kid. Whenever, I bring it up with my dad, he just stays silent and I honestly doubt that he believes its his fault. I love my parents but honestly my dad's a piece of shit. My brother's still the same fuck, he even had the audacity to say a few months ago, ""that I have forgiven myself for what I did to you even if you haven't forgiven me."" That triggered to me and I started beating his ass. And guess what, my dad got in between that being the good father he's always been. My sister told me he cried and apologized to my parents after I left the house but a few weeks later he threatened my sister with dead threats so I doubt he's changed that much. I remember only about 2 years ago, he told my sister that he would cut her head into a bunch of pieces. My sister has PTSD as well but he still fucks with her knowing he's bigger and stronger. Most of my relatives know what's happened but nobody except myself holds responsibility to him and actually acknowledges it. My mom even tries to make us get along even knowing what he's done to me and how I feel about him.

My family's failure to acknowledge that history while it still remains my burden pisses me the fuck off. My aunt whos a doctor told me that she diagnosed my brother with bipolar disorder but my parents just ignored her and didn't make him take any medication. My dad is ignorant and doesn't give a shit while my mom just wants to live this fantasy where my brother and I get along so shes constantly trying to make us do things together. I don't blame her, it sucks that her two sons don't get along but my situation is definitely worse than hers. Plus, I hate that prick. Other than that, my parents are loving and provide me with everything I need. They want me to forget about everything in the past, but it's hard when those things are still affecting me today.I have severe anxiety and it gets worse whenever I see my brother. I'm not afraid of him anymore, but my stomach just flips when I see him. I don't know how to fix this and this is one of the first times I've shared this with anyone other than my therapist.

I want to just pick up everything and abandon my family, but at the same time I can't know it's going to hurt them. I love them, but there's that grudge inside that just makes me despise everybody. What should I do? I've openly talked my issues with my parents except wanting to leave but the general response is ""what do you want us to do? It already happened"" or just silence. I don't doubt the justification for abandoning them but I don't know how to feel. Any advice on dealing with my shit?",1
924,"Scared of long time friend, please help Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.  I don't know who to turn to, or if I should be worried for my safety but I wanted to ask here in hopes that someone with more experience might be able to help.  I will try and sum up as best I can, but there is a lot, I am confused, and I don't know what is relevant.

‚Äã

My best friend for the last 20 years is now making me fear for the safety of my family.  He's been a part of my life since we were 15 and was the best man at my wedding and I was his.  He's always told me he considers my family his family and we've treated him as such.  About 5 years ago he had major back problems and needed surgery, and his wife had a miscarriage.  At this time he got many tattoos and his facebook posts became personal and sometimes hostile.  He was forced to take a leave of absence from his job, he attributed this to a hostile work environment (he is extremely progressive and he lives in a small very rural very conservative area).  The week of his surgery his wife decided to leave him, he had no one else to take him so I took the week off of work and let him stay with me.  She claimed he was abusive but she was always kind of strange and a known exaggerator and I just couldn't believe it, I'd known him my whole life.  When he stayed with me he was verbally abusive to me and told me several times that ""he could take me, we aren't kids anymore"".  We've never come to blows in our entire friendship, but I should mention I am 6'5"" and was a bouncer for many years.  I put up with the abuse long enough to get his surgery and help him recover.  A short time later after he called me an apologized profusely.  He said the adrenaline/pain/drugs mixture has made him lose it for a while.  He also told me that he had been diagnosed bipolar, he said the diagnosis came because some drug they put him on for his back made him manic and that is a known side effect if you are bipolar.  Fast forward a couple years and everything is back to normal, and I feel like I have my friend back.  He gets married again, gives me a days notice and I drop everything to be at his wedding.  Him and his wife seem happy and they seem well matched.

‚Äã

About 6 months ago he told me he had been fired from his job and was suing.  About a month ago he calls me from the bar and says he has something important to tell me but he doesn't want it to change the way I think of him.  I tell him he is like a brother and I am here for him but he doesn't want to continue the call.  A few days after that he calls me sober and tells me that him and his wife are bisexual and that they are poly amorous, I told him I was happy for him and I don't know why he was worried.  Everything seems fine.  Fast forward to two weeks ago and him and his wife are getting a divorce.

‚Äã

He visited my family on their camping trip (I was away), they were happy to support him and his new lifestyle.  But when he was there he was talking a mile a minute, and had delusions of grandeur.  He again insisted he  ""could take"" my brother-in-law who is the most physically powerful person I have ever met in my life.  My family called me told me they were worried and scared.  I called him and he was extremely scattered.  He believes he is a genius who has manipulated events in his life to give him freedom, he claimed to have saved a young person from suicide, he claimed he was going to be a professional in esports, and a few other things, honestly I was having a hard time following.  He also claimed his ex had people who wanted to hurt him because of lies she had told them.  He said he needed a place to stay and asked if he could stay with my mother (she lives much closer to him).  I told that I care about him and I want to be there for him, but that he seems very different and it was scaring me a little, and I told him that I was scared for him.  I told him I was not comfortable with him staying with my mother.  He said I have nothing to worry about that he is the same person he's always been. He asked if he could stay with me and that was not possible because (thankfully) my in-laws were visiting.  I told him I was worried about him and would drive to see him next week.

‚Äã

I got a call from my mother today that he went to her house and asked to stay with her.  She let him but she was scared, for all the same reasons as have already been mentioned.  Nothing happened but she told him he has to leave tomorrow.  She told me she is worried for me because he keeps comparing our lives (we both had difficult childhoods financially and otherwise) and he said that I have everything he wants and people should share what they have.  I have been successful and live a fairly comfortable life with my wife and young children.

‚Äã

I'm not sure what to do.  I want to help him but I am also worried he might lose it and hurt me or my family.  Am I overreacting?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

929,"I smiled at random strangers for 3 weeks and it changed my mental health   

It‚Äôs been about a year since I tried my hand at creative writing ‚Äì even getting a few short stories published, that are aimed at children aged 5-7. Each story was based around the fairly grounded lessons my mother taught me growing up; sharing nicely, thinking of others, being comfortable in your own skin, and so on - looking to try and rekindle the magic between parents and their children when reading to them at bedtime. I enjoyed writing them [(and still do)]().

More recently, I have been diagnosed with suffering from bouts of depression and anxiety. Other than being a bloody inconvenience, it‚Äôs forced me to ‚Äòthink outside the box‚Äô and take a batch of my own medicine in the form of one of my stories, by focussing on the importance of being polite. 

For the next 3 weeks I decided that if I ever catch the eye of a stranger whilst walking along, then I would smile at them politely in any way that I saw fit.

At first it was hard. I felt anxious, nervous and frankly pretty stupid ‚Äì feeling like a wombling grinning idiot ‚Äì especially when the person I smiled to didn‚Äôt smile back, or worst of all, looked at me with wide-eyed unease before picking up their walking pace.

Eventually, after about 3 days, I noticed that not only did people smile back, but my smile went from ‚Äòbeing a front‚Äô to being‚Ä¶well, genuine. I felt great and soon enough didn‚Äôt worry about those who didn‚Äôt smile back. Any tension I naturally felt during by walk to and from work slowly melted away and my sleep improved massively. It was a personal experiment that I try to implement at least twice a week.

Plus, my teeth are kinda neglected at this point already, so I get very anxious that they're just going to start turning yellow and falling out.

937,"It's been a month since school got out and I still have nightmares about forgetting homework, failing tests or being unprepared One of my biggest fears is rejection and failure. I hold myself to extreme standards but then I don't act upon it. For example if I want to get a 90% in the class, I know I'll have to get a 102% on the final. But then I don't study and end up getting a bad score. Then I mope in my failure for days about how I could have done better. 

Sometimes my teachers gives the class tests that take up more than the 50 minutes of class we have. If I have to stay past the bell, I start panicking and hyperventilating and *almost* crying. 

My school has an online grade checking system. I log in to my grades 2-4 times a day constantly checking my grades. Especially if I took a test the day before. I consistently worry about failing that sometimes in bed I start to shake and freak out. 

I'm assigned summer homework this year and I can't get it out of my head. It's a constant *You need to do this now or you'll fail at life*. And I still have a 1.5 months to do it. 

We can pick lockers and I've always wanted one on the edge so I can get to it without having to knock into people. I want it so badly that I've had at least 2 nightmares about not getting the locker or any locker at all.

939,"Beware of toxic positivity Saw a Facebook post about this on my timeline so I guess I'll try to bring it over here. 

We've all probably heard unhelpful advice like ""Just think positive!"" or ""Stop being so negative"" or my own most-hated ""GOOD VIBES ONLY!!"" (and my parents are big fans of ""get happy!"") The reason this advice is unhelpful is that it does not acknowledge that someone is actually suffering. It does not relate to our specific cases. It sounds like generic advice. And it puts the burden on us to adjust. (Feeling down? Just think positively!)

So rather than ""You'll get over it!"", try ""This is hard. You've done hard things before and I believe in you.""

Rather than ""Just be positive!"", try ""I know there's a lot that could go wrong. What could go right?""

Rather than ""Good vibes only!"" try ""All vibes are welcome here.""

Rather than ""Stop being so negative!"" try ""It's normal to have some negativity in situations like this.""

Rather than ""think happy thoughts!"" try ""It's probably pretty hard to be positive right now. I'm putting good energy out in the world for you.""

Rather than ""Never give up!"" try ""Giving up is OK sometimes. What is your ideal outcome?""

Rather than ""Just be happy!"" try ""It's never fun to feel like that. Is there something we/you can do today that you'd enjoy?""

Rather than ""see the good in everything!"" try ""It's probably hard to see the good in this situation. We can make sense of it later.""

I don't 100% agree with all of these alternative responses but it's a lot better than toxic positivity",1

942,"I'm tired of people in positions of power not taking mental health seriously. Today was the closest I've ever come to killing myself.  The details of why are irrelevant to the rant I'm posting now, so I'm going to forego all that; but basically I had to leave work and was so convinced I was going to just jump in front of traffic that I actually scared myself into calling my boyfriend (who was at work) to come and get me as I was scared to be alone.  He attempted to tell his manager that he had an emergency with my mental health and the guy nonchalantly said there was no one to cover and to take out the trash.  I live away from my family and had already called some friends to with no luck.  I was juggling between calling a hotline and/or 911, or just offing myself because I know I can't afford a hospital stay when fortunately one of my friends called back and rushed to pick me up.  My BF's boss sent him home 2 hours later for a bad attitude.

Now that I've calmed down a little bit from all the events and am left with a giant bump on my head from smacking myself in frustration I am absolutely livid that my BF's supervisors would treat a situation like that.  Not everyone has the luxury of having a giant network of people to get support from and one of the only people I have is him, especially since we live together.  I don't think I should have to put myself in the hospital or die for people to take it seriously but apparently it's not real since I didn't actually jump in front of that car.

Sorry, I mostly needed to rant but would also love opinions on what to do if I feel this way again, and also on whether you think my anger is justified.

tldr: got scary close to killing myself today, was all alone, BF's boss wouldn't let him leave to come help me and now I'm pissed at how no one seems to take mental health seriously.",1

947,"I finally told my mom. Not good results. I am 22 years old man living with my parents (NC, US) and I have been dealing with things since middle school. I decided to tell her because I have been struggling with this for a long time. Which the only reason I was able to tonight is because I drunk a little bit of alcohol. It helped me overcome the fears of talking and asking for help that I have had since middle school. Week after week I previously would chicken out.

I finally told my mom but it didnt go well. She kept saying things like ""Oh everyone has been through it"" You can read the other post on my account for some of the things I go through. I dont want to repeat it because I have highlighted most of it in my other post which I talked about me having very bad anxiety(with half of it from social stuff), Paranoria? (Which I say that because I think everyone is talking bad about me 24/7 and plotting to make me feel like the dirt I am by bullying me or beating me up. This includes my parents which I feel like they are talking about how they will make me homeless soon when they kick me out), OCD which would consist of perfectionism and picking all over my body(face, arms, underarms, and privates)

She took everything wrong with me bad. While trying to talk it out with her she walked out on me many times to smoke and said I needed help. She tried to equate what I told her to stuff she went through for a portion of time. When i told her I want to talk about me and the stuff I went through for over 15 years of my life she got pissed at me and let me know that a general physician would fix all this as she knows her kid will not need a therapist or psychologist.

I know she is disappointed in me. I can feel or how she talked to me. So much aggressiveness and she would jump on me when I would physically cringe at her talking. She promised not to tell my dad but I don't know. I know they talk about me behind my back. I wonder how it will be when a general physician sees me and realised who I am as they wont help me but they will join in with the making fun of me. I wish I could set up appointments on my own but all the contacting is daunting. Then again no matter who it is when they see me or my name they will know this boy is the scum of the earth so let's treat him like that and bully him like he deserves. 

By me making this post, I dont want anyone not to talk to there parents. You may be in a different situation. I am just scared to death as I know for a fact my parents will hate me for the rest of my life now that I semi-fully opened up. I wish I had someone I could talk about everything with but unfortunately this life is set for everyone to hate me and want me to feel like dirt.

I honestly just need help but I am too afraid to reach out and get any.

I am a senior in high school and everything has been so rough lately. I have lost almost all of my friends the past year and I have nobody to talk to. All of my best friends have grown apart from me mainly because of high school popularity, and now they act like I don‚Äôt even exist. Lately I have been trying so hard to make friends And have been busy socializing at parties just to make friends that I haven‚Äôt done any college application stuff. Even if I wanted to apply I‚Äôm pretty sure no college would take me.I feel like a failure because I all I see and hear is people talking about what college they are going to and how great their lives are going to be after high school etc. I feel that way because I am going to be stuck at my parents house attending a community college that‚Äôs only a few minutes away. Normally I could rant to my parents and tell them whatever is on my mind but I can‚Äôt do that at all lately without them screaming and yelling at me. For some reason the past 6 months they have treated me like absolute shit and I have no idea why. My mother for the first time ever beat me so hard because of my ‚Äúattitude‚Äùthat my shoulder was covered in bruises. (I think my mother is going through something and I am very stressed about her mental health)My father forced me to get a job that I absolutely hate and everyone at that work treats me like crap(I told my father repeatedly that I was looking for a job before I got this one) I‚Äôve tried to apply to other places because I am absolutely miserable, but when my parents found out they threatened to kick me out. I would be fine with moving out but the problem is I‚Äôm in debt and make almost nothing. I wish I wasn‚Äôt so stupid in high school so that I could actually go to college and leave this hell hole. All I can think about is the past with all my friends when I never had to worry about money and other things.i truly wish I could go back so bad and all I think constantly think about is how different and great my life was two years ago. My father has made it clear that he is not going to help me pay at all for any classes and that he expects me to do everything on my own within the next year. I do not find this fair at all because I have an older brother who has Aspergers who works the same job as me, and can almost do everything on his own.( you would never be able to tell he has it)My parents treat him like the golden child. In their eyes he can do no wrong. They always yell at me and compare me to my brother saying things like ‚ÄúYour brother can do ___ better than you and he‚Äôs got Aspergers.‚ÄùThey also told me that I have to fully take care of my brother when I am older. I honestly think I‚Äôm going to fail community college and be stuck at a job that I absolutely hate making no money and being poor and miserable the rest of my life. How can I help my brother when I can barely help myself. I truly don‚Äôt want to grow up and have to do all this. I pray every night that I don‚Äôt wake up.I am truly contemplating killing myself.

954,"I'm A Maladaptive Daydreamer. Here's my story. **Important Note:** I am *not* schizophrenic, nor do I have multiple personalities. These are different disorders entirely.

Anyone else here a maladaptive daydreamer? I'm in the UK and, although it's not officially recognised as a personality disorder here, it still exists haha.

An adult survivor of physical, mental, emotional and even lowkey verbal-sexual assault as a child, I can only assume that it was a coping mechanism. I've spent a lot of my life quite detached and lonely due to a lack of family love and as a result a hard time making or keeping friends as a child. I was also the ""scruffy"" kid at school

Being an MD can be... distracting. If I am alone and not completely focused on something 100%, my mind it is a whirlin'. The characters, settings, storylines and whatnot will vary. Sometimes it's short and related to an immediate trigger and other times it's long-winded and goes on for weeks before the ""story"" fizzles out and a new one begins.

It's hard to explain the difference between regular over-active imaginations and MD. Here are some things I might do whilst daydreaming:

- Rock back and forth mildly   
- Pace up and down  
- Making facial expressions to go with the conversation that is happening  
- Zoning out from the ""here and now"" when deep in a daydream  
- Sometimes struggling to be social because my brain wants to daydream instead (toilet breaks make for the ""crack snorting"" moments where you get a quick daydream in - on those days, much like an addict, you have to 'recompose' yourself to go back into the group and act normal)
- Unable to focus on anything else or, if I do, the daydream coincides with what I'm doing

 If in **public**, I don't ""act out"" the daydream, but I find it tough not to make facial expressions that go along with the dialogue in my head if I start to zone out or find myself alone for a moment. I try to control it, I get very paranoid if I see a passer by just happen to look over at me, and sometimes wonder if I've accidentally spoken out loud, lol  

In **private**, there are no bars. I talk out loud, make full facial expressions, hand gestures, walking around, etc.

**Now here's the interesting thing, and also the hardest part to explain**.

Can I ""control"" it? Yes.   
The daydreams are always within my full control; I do not 'hear voices', I am the voices. I do not have multiple personalities, I have one and this is it. I do not feel scared, threatened or like something may happen. Even when the daydreams are scary or dangerous, it's just another storyline, like playing out a horror movie I guess. It's just a ""movie"", it isn't real.

Can I ""control"" it? No.  
I can't stop the daydreams happening. Even if I try to do so, I just zone out and wind up accidentally in another one. 

The simple version: I can control what happens when I daydream, I just can't control THAT I daydream. Imagine a form of ADHD where you can't sit still or focus on what a teacher is saying. It's like that, except your body isn't hyper, it's your imagination.

I am eager to hear from anyone else with MD or your thoughts in general if you've never even heard of MD!

My husband's mother claims that she has developed Foreign Accent Syndrome. She was in a mild car accident in a parking lot a few weeks ago where both cars pulled out of parking spaces at the same time, and it left a dent in the fender of the other car but didn't damage ours. She says that she thinks she has a delayed reaction to that car accident. She has gone from speaking in a Southern accent to speaking with an accent that sounds mostly English. This all started three days ago.

My mother in law has always been a hypochondriac so we are taking this with a grain of salt, however-- there's always the chance that she is either completely right and she has developed this syndrome, or there is something else going on with her that is causing this. 

We are her caretakers. She lives in our house and is financially dependent on us. Since the parking lot incident we have decided that she isn't well enough to drive. She has practically no money and we would be footing the bill for any doctor's visits. She does have Medicare. I'm afraid that we will be bouncing from specialist to specialist unless we get an idea of where to go. Does this require a therapist? A neurologist? I don't even really know where to start. She is pushing us to take her to see a doctor because she thinks that her accent is an indication that something happened to her brain when she was in the car accident. She tells us that she can ""feel her brain bleed."" When we ask if she should go to the emergency room and get an MRI and any other pertinent tests to see if her brain is okay she refuses. She wants to see a doctor, but doesn't want to be tested. I'm at the end of my rope here. What do we do?

If someone gives me a really really awesome gift, I know Im supposed to be excited, so I act like I am.

I was diagnosed at 8 with ADHD and general anxiety disorder. I didn't know this until i was 22 and had always thought i was just a weird person who was destined to feel different and more hyper than everyone. It made me feel like a social pariah and like I wasn't deserving of love. At 19 though, I did come to terms with part of my identity: I was an alcoholic.

I had binge drank, drunk drove, got sent to the hospital, got in blackout fights, and finally after shitting my pants one night after a particularly bad blackout (i drank tobasco sauce in addition to a bottle of grey goose and 10 beers). I decided enough was enough. 3 months later i was in AA and stringing together consistent sobriety. 6 months after that my mom admitted she was an alcoholic and quit with me (she is now 4 and a half years sober).

So why do i share this? who cares? THAT IS MY POINT. People do care. people out there feel the same and work on writing to a reddit forum to hide their identity and talk about these things. Well, I am trying to be more public about my mental illness. I started a website ([]()) and I started streaming to talk to teens and young adults about mental illness.

If you feel like noone understands you, give me a shot. I will at least do my best to understand and at the VERY LEAST I will hear you and show you you are loved.

We can't all be blessed with money, or health, or happiness, but we sure as hell can try to improve together.

Love all,

976,"Spouse in psych ward pt. 2 So I'm hoping to use these posts as a means to vent, gather information and support, etc. But I also would like to have daily updates.. Maybe seeing it happening  in pseudo real time will help others who may be in the beginning stages of something like this. 

First off, the overwhelming support I've received from random internet strangers has blow me away! You're all awesome! None of you know me personally, but have helped with my struggles and anxiety. It truly is amazing what the internet can be when it comes through positively and compassionately.

Anyway, about today. So most of the day was rough. There was no improvement from yesterday. She was refusing medication out of distrust of the nurses and refused to see a psychiatrist or therapist out of a fear they were trying to kill her. She would call me and my father and ask us to get her, or to help others escape. Same delusional thoughts. But the end of the night was.. kind of nice. She accepted some medicine and it put her to sleep, but before she went to bed she called, and through the tired, slurred voice I heard the most beautiful phrase I've ever heard: ""I love you baby, goodnight "". It was short and sweet but it was the best thing I've heard, and I feel a lot better tonight. I'm going to sleep tonight, a little more hopefully. Tomorrow is a new day and I'm excited/anxious to see how it goes. I'll keep updating. Thank you everyone!",1
977,"Is it normal for a person with depression to have 2 sides in their mind arguing with each other? Whenever my mind isn't occupied by something like a video game or watching a show, it tends to go on a bit of a self deprecating path. And 2 sides of me popup, one that wants to be positive and to tell myself that these thoughts mean nothing and I should be more happy about myself, then the other one does the opposite.

978,"We are fighters It makes me so sad to see how many of us suffer with our mental health, how hard it is to get support and professional help and just how hard it can be for us to open up and let others in.
But by still being here, by posting here, by waking up every morning, we are fighting and it shows just how strong we all are even though it doesn't feel like it! 
It's tough but we got it guys! We got this!",1
979,"This morning routine alleviates my anxiety/depression- 1. Go to bed by 11 PM at the latest
2. Wake up by 6:30 AM at the latest- Start getting hydrated
3. Do a *resistance* training workout, or anything to **elevate the heart rate** for 30+minutes 
4. Keep drinking water throughout workout (during breaks)
5. Take L-Theanine after the workout (At least 150 mg)
6. Take 50-100 mg of caffeine
7. *Fast* until lunch time. 
8. At lunch, eat mostly protein and healthy fats (half an avacado is great), and a little bit of carbs

Working out stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, the L-Theanine and Caffeine work with each other to elevate mood without the jitters from caffeine. Fasting until lunch prolongs the calming effects and keeps you from getting tired after eating a meal in the morning. Keeping carb intake low during lunch prevents an insulin spike which can also make one crash.

It takes discipline, but it's been worth it. ",1
980,"Having depression and anxiety really REALLY sucks+social media is a no no so I‚Äôll use Reddit instead of Twitter to talk about my life okayyy:) I realized soo many things before I was diagnosed. Once I was diagnosed in December with major depression and anxiety, all things I was oblivious towards became very eye opening. I ended toxic relationships, started changing my life choices, etc. It‚Äôs been about 7 months already and I can only say, this school year was total crap. I mean, yes, I had a wonderful boyfriend/bestfriend who eventually understood a little about my mental illness. I had graduated high school‚Äîwhich was tough due to not going for months. I finally felt life was just beginning. But then the mood changes, the distance between loved ones, the side effects from my medication, not having more appointments with my therapist and skipping my meds led up to chaos. Also, it‚Äôs barely July and even MORE chaos happened. My grandmother found out she has pancreatic cancer, so ya know how that‚Äôll end, my boyfriend and I broke up‚ÄîI realized it was my fault though, plus I‚Äôm always alone. But I‚Äôll type the rest tomorrow.

Anywhooo it‚Äôs tomorrow jaja. I feel good today. I worked out, I did a hair mask in the shower+ I‚Äôm going to Target later to release my stress and buy a ton of things I don‚Äôt think I need until I actually get there and Target tells me I need it:) I‚Äôm hoping the remainder of summer feels freaking great. I bought a couple of books a month ago and I should really start reading them. I guess all I‚Äôm trying to say is that I will be alright bc I said so. It‚Äôs okay for me to be sad and cry and scream bc I SAID SO! Once all that is released, I can make changes to myself. ",1

986,"23, living with parents, single, bored, lonely, depressed and soon to be unemployed. I (23f) just finished college and, for purely financial reasons/not having a job, had to move back to my hometown and into my childhood bedroom. While I am grateful for my parents' hospitality, I am extremely unhappy, depressed and can't see the point in life any more.

Been doing an internship at a reputable company over the summer - so at least that's something. I was lucky and landed a paid internship which adds valuable experience to my CV. But this internship finishes in two weeks' time and I've yet to land a graduate job. So there is no end in sight to living with my parents.

I have basically zero social life - the only good friends that live nearby are a married couple and whenever we hang out I feel like I'm getting in their way/a third wheel, so I've been spending less and less time with them recently. I have many acquaintances from the internship and in the neighbourhood, but we aren't quite on the same wavelength and I don't want to force friendship where there isn't one. I'm not close with my family - they all live hermit lifestyles and don't like to spend any time with each other or me. Loneliness and isolation is really taking its toll.

As well as this, I'm single. Never had a serious relationship because I always get broken up with after 2-3 months of casual dating. I've given up on meeting someone in a serious capacity and feel it isn't worth the heartache any more.

I struggle with my mental health anyway, but this is really bad. I feel depressed, lonely and incredibly bored and can't see a way for it to get better any time soon. I'm applying for jobs and trying to channel the negative energy/use it as motivation to prepare for job interviews, but it's still really hard. I have no joy or excitement in life - every day I spend alone either in my bedroom or at the local library on the computer job searching. I've tried exercising (running, going on long walks, swimming), reading books, browsing dating sites, learning to cook new meals and practising gratitude, but nothing seems to help long-term.

Just needed to get that out there and wonder if anyone could offer any advice...",1
987,Left the house with short shorts on. I never wear short shorts cuz of scars on my legs and I'm also super self conscious. I finally felt like wearing them. I'm still somewhat self conscious but I'm starting to feel better and I think I look good.,1
988,The best way I‚Äôve been able to describe my anxiety to my mother: ‚ÄúI feel like I am a can of soda that has been violently shaken but cannot be opened; I feel like the soda.‚Äù Also ‚ÄúI feel as though I am zooming around the room but standing still‚Äù ,1
989,"I'm too worn down to keep going This isn't a throw away account. I honestly don't care. All of my life I have had severe anxiety/depression. In my late 20's I was diagnosed with PTSD due to many many many childhood/adolescent events. I was always still able to achieve success at work and in my personal life. I bought a house at 25 and life was going good...Then I lost my house, dog, and everything I worked for in an ugly divorce because my ex wife cheated on me with someone who made a lot of money. I was left with my clothes and my guitars.  

Since then life has gone nowhere but downhill. I had to move in with my parents (yes, I'm lucky to have had that option). But, within 6 months I had to call the police on my dad for trying to kill my mom while I was at work. I put my father in jail for 3 years. 1 week later my best friend tried to kill himself in front of me, but I stopped him and called 911. I saved his life. But he doesn't speak to me anymore because my calling 911 cost him $5,000. 

Presently, I am off of work on doctor's orders. I haven't worked since September 2017. I was fainting/passing out, even while driving. I couldn't concentrate and my motor skills were becoming non existent. After dozens of tests the doctors have concluded that my fainting (syncope) is due to my brain being overloaded and simply causing me to pass out as a ""defense mechanism"".  My anxiety and PTSD have taken over my life. 

I have not gotten paid since being off of work, despite having short term/long term disability through my insurance. My insurance claims that what my neurologist and psychiatrist are saying is impossible. I have sold almost all of my valued possessions on Craigslist just to pay what bills I can. 

Now I am being sued by a law firm representing a collection agency because I can't afford to pay my bill at the moment. I have 3 cents in my bank account. I tried to see what kind of money I could earn by streaming on Twitch, but my disability is making it impossible for me to be on camera in front of people. I have scrapped everything metal that I could at the scrapyard for money.

 I am completely out of resources and hope. I am a drain on my family and friends financially and emotionally. I started working when I was 15 at a grocery store and have always had a job since. I was a supervisor for a food production factory and then took a better job as an account manager for a Fortune 500 company. I am almost 36 years old. 20 years of hard work and overcoming any obstacles I faced. Now I feel like a shell of who I used to be. I am nothing. Everyone treats me differently than before. I am losing everything. I have run out of options. I can't live like this anymore. 

I just feel too tired to push on. But I do because I don't want to put my mother through the grief of losing a child. So I just live stagnantly. I don't know what to do anymore. I just want it to go away.",1

Every time I get close to someone they backstab me and this issue is starting to really affect me. I can't get in close friendships and it's hindering my day to day life. Like when my godfather's cat died (which i loved and has been in my life as long as i can remember) died I didn't cry I felt like a monster. Who loses a pet and doesn't give a shit. Again the same thing happened with my grandfather's passing and my other pets passing.
